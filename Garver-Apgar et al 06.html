ABSTRACT
Preferences for mates that possess genes dis-similar to one’s own at the major histocompatibility com-plex (MHC), a polymorphic group of loci associated withthe immune system, have been found in mice, birds, fish,and humans. These preferences may help individualschoose genetically compatible mates and may adaptivelyfunction to prevent inbreeding or to increase heterozy-gosity and thereby immunocompetence of offspring. MHC-dissimilar mate preferences may influence the psychologyof sexual attraction. We investigated whether MHC simi-larity among romantically involved couples (N 5 48)predicted aspects of their sexual relationship. All women inour sample normally ovulated, and alleles at three MHCloci were typed for each person. As the proportion of MHCalleles couples shared increased, women’s sexual respon-sivity to their partners decreased, their number of extra-pair sexual partners increased, and their attraction tomen other than their primary partners increased, par-ticularly during the fertile phase of their cycles.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC), found in verte-brates, is a set of genes coding for cell-surface markers theimmune system uses to discriminate self from pathogens. MHCloci are highly polymorphic; there are many different variantsindividuals could possess at each gene site. Two unrelated in-dividuals, then, are unlikely to possess identical MHC geno-types. Mice can detect MHC identities in scents of other mice(Yamazaki, Beauchamp, Curran, Baird, & Boyse, 2000) and prefer mates who possess dissimilar MHC genotypes, based onscent (Penn & Potts, 1999). Such preferences also exist inspecies of birds (Freeman-Gallant, Meguerdichian, Wheel-wright, & Sollecito, 2003), fish (Milinski et al., 2005), and liz-ards (Olsson et al., 2003), though not all vertebrate speciespossess them (e.g., Sommer, 2005).Studies examining this preference in humans have yieldedgenerally supportive but mixed evidence. Preferences for thescent of opposite-sex individuals with dissimilar MHC geno-types have been detected in three of four studies of normallyovulating women (Santos, Schinemann, Gabardo, & Bicalho,2005; Wedekind & Fu¨ri, 1997; Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, &Paepke, 1995; cf. Thornhill et al., 2003)1 and two of threestudies of men (Thornhill et al., 2003; Wedekind & Fu¨ri, 1997;cf. Santos et al., 2005). A study of Hutterites found marriedcouples to be more MHC-dissimilar than expected by chance(Ober et al., 1997); studies of South American Indian and Jap-anese couples did not (Hedrick & Black, 1997a; Ihara, Aoki,Tokumaga, Takahashi, & Juji, 2000).Two non-mutually exclusive, adaptive hypotheses may ex-plain MHC-dissimilar mate preferences (Penn & Potts, 1999).First, they may suppress inbreeding. Second, MHC-dissimilarmates produce offspring who are heterozygous at MHC loci.MHC alleles are expressed codominantly, with each coding fordifferent cell-surface receptors. Relative to two redundantcopies of a single allele, then, two distinct MHC alleles at a locuspermit the immune system to recognize a greater range of foreignpeptides (Brown, 1997). Indeed, heterozygous mice are more fitthan homozygous mice when multiple strains of pathogens are present (Penn, Damjanovich, & Potts, 2002). Among offspring ofhuman couples who share MHC alleles, homozygotes areunderrepresented, possibly because of in utero selection againsthomozygotes (Hedrick & Black, 1997b).Given a sex difference in minimum parental investment(Trivers, 1972), past selection pressures favoring geneticallycompatible mate choices may have been stronger on women thanmen. Accumulating evidence suggests that women possessadaptive design to seek genetic benefits for offspring at mid-cycle, when they are fertile (see Gangestad, Thornhill, & Garver-Apgar, 2005a, 2005b; also Havlicek, Roberts, & Flegr, 2005;Puts, 2005). Hence, preferences for MHC compatibility may besensitive to women’s fertility status (cf. Thornhill et al., 2003).The current study is the first to test the hypothesis that MHCsimilarity predicts aspects of actual human sexual relationships.Specifically, we asked whether women paired with men withwhom they share a relatively high proportion of MHC alleles,compared with women paired with men with whom they share arelatively low proportion of MHC alleles, are (a) less sexuallyresponsive to their partners, (b) more likely to have had extrapairsex (sex with someone other than their partner) while involvedwith their partners, and (c) more attracted to extrapair men,particularly during the fertile phase of their cycles. We alsoexamined the first two questions with respect to men and ex-plored other aspects of couples’ sex across the cycle.

METHOD
Participants were 48 romantically involved heterosexual couplesrecruited at the University of New Mexico. All women (ages 18–35) were normally ovulating. Participants were compensated with$20 plusresearchcreditfora psychology course orwith either$50(if male) or $70 (if female). Mean ages were 20.5 and 21.3 for thewomen and men, respectively (SD 5 3.1 and 3.2). All coupleswere dating exclusively (n 5 36), cohabiting (n 5 5), or married(n 5 7). No participant was divorced. Five women and 6 men hadchildren; 4 couples had children together. Median relationshipduration was 17 months (range 5 1 month to 12 years). Foranalyses, relationship duration was truncated to 99 months andlog-transformed to reduce positive skew; untransformed valuesyielded identical results. For 1 couple, data on age and relation-ship duration were missing; mean values were imputed.The couples reported for three questionnaire sessions: one atthe start of the study, one scheduled during the fertile period ofthe woman’s cycle, and one scheduled during the nonfertile,luteal phase. Women reported to the lab for luteinizing hormone(LH) tests (using the over-the-counter Ovusigns tester) for up to5 days, self-testing on weekends (verified by lab inspection) ifnecessary. All women included in the analyses surged within5 days after or 2 days prior to their high-fertility session. Low-fertility sessions were conducted more than 5 days after an LHsurge; we tried not to schedule these sessions during the last 3days of the cycle Individuals completed questionnaires in separate privaterooms. During the initial session, we obtained the following measures:

	-  Relationship satisfaction on 29 attributes: Two of these at-tributes were central to our hypotheses: ‘‘the extent to which[the relationship partner turns] me on sexually’’ and ‘‘howsexually adventurous [the relationship partner is] (with me).’’Others included ‘‘financial resources,’’ ‘‘physical attractive-ness,’’ ‘‘faithfulness and loyalty,’’ ‘‘intelligence,’’ and ‘‘ambi-tion.’’2 Participants responded on 9-point scales ranging from1 (my partner does not satisfy me at all on this condition) to 9(my partner completely satisfies me on this condition).

	-  Partner’s perceived satisfaction: Individuals rated their per-ception of their partners’ satisfaction with them on the same29 attributes, using 9-point scales ranging from 1 (I do notsatisfy my partner at all on this condition) to 9 (I completelysatisfy my partner on this condition).

	-  Ellis’s (1998) Partner-Specific Investment Inventory (both self-and partner-reports): For the analyses reported here, we usedresponses to five self-reported items (two reverse-coded) in thisinventory that concern sexual responsivity: ‘‘I want to have sexwithmypartner,’’ ‘‘I trytopleasemypartner sexually,’’ ‘‘Irefuseto have sex with my partner,’’ ‘‘With my partner, I am a willingand enthusiastic sexual partner,’’ and ‘‘I am not sexually re-sponsive to my partner.’’ Participants responded to the firstthree items on a 5-point scale from 0 (never) to 4 (very often) andtothelasttwo itemsona 5-point scale from1 (stronglydisagree)to 5 (strongly agree). Partner-reported items had identicalcontent, with appropriately altered pronouns (e.g., ‘‘My partnerwants to have sex with me’’). Responses were aggregated toform separate self- and partner-reports.

	-  Number of sex partners: Participants reported the number ofindividuals other than their primary partner with whom theyhad sex while being romantically involved with their currentprimary partner, as well as with previous primary partners.

	-  Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI; Simpson & Gange-stad, 1991): This instrument measures willingness to have sexin the absence of emotional closeness and commitment.

During sessions on low- and high-fertility days, we asked par-ticipants to report on their experiences, thoughts, and feelingsin the past 2 days. Two questions assessed individuals’ sexualattraction to their own partners during this period: ‘‘I felt strongsexual attraction toward my primary current partner’’ and‘‘I fantasized about sex with a current partner.’’ Five questionsassessed women’s sexual attraction to men other than their partner: ‘‘I felt strong sexual attraction toward someone otherthan a current partner,’’ ‘‘I fantasized about sex with a stranger oracquaintance,’’ ‘‘I fantasized about sex with a past partner,’’ ‘‘Ifelt sexually aroused by the sight of a very physically attractiveperson (other than a primary current partner),’’ and ‘‘I felt sex-ually aroused by the scent of someone (other than a primarycurrent partner).’’ Participants responded to these seven ques-tions on 5-point scales ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (a greatdeal). Values were summed across items to create compositemeasures of attraction to partner and attraction to extrapair in-dividuals. During these sessions, both male and female partic-ipants recorded the number of times in the past 2 days that theyhad engaged in a variety of sexual behaviors. See Table 1 for alist of these behaviors.During one session, cells were scraped away from mucosalmembranes on the inside of each participant’s mouth and pre-served. DNA was later typed for MHC alleles at the A, B, andDRb loci (see Thornhill et al., 2003). We successfully typed atleast two loci for each individual; all three loci were typed for 37couples (77%), and 92% of all possible loci were typed. Becausecomplete typing was not available for all couples, we used theproportion of shared alleles at typed loci (range 5 0 to .67) as ourmeasure of MHC sharing.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Relationship duration and participant’s age were statisticallycontrolled in all analyses. Following Killeen (2005), we report prep rather than conventional p values. Unless otherwise noted,predicted effects were significant by directed conventional testsat p < .05 (Rice & Gaines, 1994).

Women’s Sexual Responsivity and Satisfaction
As predicted, as the proportion of shared MHC alleles in-creased, women reported that they were less sexually responsiveto their partners, r(41) 5 =.35, prep 5 .945, and men reportedthat their partners were less sexually responsive to them, r(39) 5=.33, prep 5 .932 (see Fig. 1).Similarly, as MHC sharing increased, women’s satisfaction withthe extent to which their partner aroused them sexually decreased,as assessed by their own reports,r(43) 5 =.30, prep 5 .919,andbytheir partners’ reports, r(43) 5 =.27, prep 5 .893. MHC sharingnegatively predicted men’s satisfaction with how sexually adven-turous their partner was with them, r(42) 5 =.31, prep 5 .922;the association with women’s reports of men’s satisfaction withwomen’s sexual adventurousness fell short of statistical signifi-cance, r(43) 5 =.25, p 5 .062, prep 5 .878.Of 27 other components of relationship satisfaction rated bymen and women (none directly pertaining to sexual satisfaction)for both self and partner—108 ratings altogether—MHC shar-ing significantly predicted 8 (7.4%), a result close to chancelevels. For none of these other components of relationshipsatisfaction did it significantly predict both self- and partner-reports. Though it is predictive of women’s sexual satisfaction,MHC sharing does not broadly predict relationship satisfaction.

Women’s Extrapair Sex
As MHC sharing increased, women reported more extrapairsexual partners during the current relationship, r(43) 5 .28,prep 5 .908. This association held when women’s generalwillingness to have casual sex (SOI score) was controlled,r(42) 5 .33, prep 5 .939. As expected, MHC sharing did notpredict the number of extrapair partners women reported fromprevious relationships, r(42) 5 =.10, prep 5 .676, n.s., or theSOI score, r(43) 5 =.02, prep 5 .530, n.s. A repeated measuresanalysis showed that MHC sharing predicted the number ofextrapair partners in the current relationship significantly morepositively than it predicted the number of extrapair partners inpast relationships, F(1, 42) 5 9.12, prep > .978, Z 5 .42.

Changes in Women’s Sexual Attraction and Fantasy
Across the Cycle
We conducted a 2 (fertility status: high vs. low fertility)  2(target: partner vs. extrapair men) repeated measures analysis ofvariance on women’s reports of attraction and fantasy, with MHCsharing treated as a quantitative predictor and order of session(high fertility first vs. low fertility first) controlled as a between-subjects factor. (One couple was excluded because they were nolonger involved during the last two sessions.) A significantTarget  MHC Sharing interaction emerged, F(1, 36) 5 5.11,prep 5 .938, Z 5 .35; MHC sharing predicted attraction toextrapair men more positively than it predicted attraction topartners. Also as predicted, fertility status moderated thisinteraction, F(1, 36) 5 6.76, prep 5 .960, Z 5 .40. Follow-upanalyses on fertile women revealed a sizable Target  MHCSharing interaction, F(1, 36) 5 11.35, prep 5 .986; MHCsharing predicted fertile women’s attraction to extrapair men,r(36) 5 .41, prep 5 .964, but not their attraction to primary partners, r(36) 5 =.20, p 5 .146, prep 5 .800. Analyses onnonfertile women’s attraction yielded no comparable inter-action, F(1, 36) 5 0.42, n.s., prep 5 .675; for these women,sharing did not predict attraction to extrapair men or topartners during the luteal phase, r(36) 5 .08, prep 5 .633, andr(36) 5 =.08, prep 5 .629, n.s.

Men’s Sexual Responsivity and Extrapair Sex
We found no evidence that MHC sharing predicts men’s sexualresponsivity to partners, whether self- or partner-reported,r(37) 5 =.12, prep 5 .691, and r(39) 5 =.09, prep 5 .645, n.s., ormen’s satisfaction with their partners’ ability to arouse themsexually, r(42) 5 =.13, prep 5 .719, and r(42) 5 =.02, prep 5.527, n.s. Men reported no increase in extrapair sex asthe proportion of shared MHC alleles increased, r(40) 5 =.11,prep 5 .683, n.s. As MHC sharing increased, men perceivedpartners to be less satisfied with their sexual adventurousness,r(42) 5 =.29, prep 5 .915, but women’s self-reports for this itemrevealed no effect of MHC sharing, r(42) 5 .11, prep 5 .696, n.s.Future research should further evaluate the null results reportedhere for the relation between men’s sexual responsivity andMHC sharing.

Additional Measures
Table 1 presents partial correlations between reported fre-quencies of sexual behaviors and MHC sharing, both overall andon high- and low-fertility days. MHC sharing did not predictfrequency of sex. As sharing increased, however, women moreoften rejected partners’ attempts to initiate sex (particularlywhen they were fertile) or consented to sex only after threats orarguments by partners. When fertile, women experienced fewerorgasms with partners as MHC sharing increased, an interestingfinding in light of conjectures that women’s orgasm functions toretain sperm in the female reproductive tract (Baker & Bellis,1995).

MHC Sharing
On average, couples shared 0.98 alleles—17.2% of those typed.By chance under random mating, they would have shared20.3%. This difference fell short of statistical significance,t(47) 5 1.26, p 5 .137, prep 5 .808. We analyzed Class I (A andB) and Class II (DRb) loci separately. For Class I loci, there was significant disassortative pairing: 14.6% shared vs. 20.5% bychance, t(47) 5 significant disassortative pairing: 14.6% shared vs. 20.5% bychance, t(47) 5 =2.21, prep 5 .928. On DRb, we found nodisassortative pairing: 22.3% shared vs. 20.3% by chance,t(46) 5 0.51, prep 5 .640, n.s. Because only Class I receptorspresent self-peptides, perhaps they alone produce certain in-formation about their nature (e.g., through self-peptides shedfrom skin) that can be detected in scent (e.g., Leinders-Zufall etal., 2004). Associations presented in this report, however, werenot driven by sharing at Class I loci alone.

CONCLUSION
This study provides the first evidence that MHC sharing nega-tively predicts women’s sexual responsivity to and sexual sat-isfaction with partners. Associations emerged with both self-and partner-reports, which strongly suggests that these effectsare real. Furthermore, as MHC sharing increases, women reportmore extrapair partners (but only in the current relationship) andexperience greater attraction to extrapair men relative to theirpartners, particularly on fertile days of their cycles. These ef-fects may be mediated by scent, though explicit investigation ofthat possibility awaits future research.2.21, prep 5 .928.
