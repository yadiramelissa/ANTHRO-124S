Menstrual cycle variation in women's preferences for the scent of symmetrical men

Steven W. Gangestad1 and Randy Thornhill2

Evidence suggests that female sexual preferences change across the menstrual cycle. Women's extra-paircopulations tend to occur in their most fertile period, whereas their intra-pair copulations tend to bemore evenly spread out across the cycle. This pattern is consistent with women preferentially seeking menwho evidence phenotypic markers of genetic benefits just before and during ovulation. This study examinedwhether women's olfactory preferences for men's scent would tend to favour the scent of more symmetricalmen, most notably during the women's fertile period. College women sniffed and rated the attractiveness ofthe scent of 41 T-shirts worn over a period of two nights by different men. Results indicated that normallycycling (non-pill using) women near the peak fertility of their cycle tended to prefer the scent of shirts wornby symmetrical men. Normally ovulating women at low fertility within their cycle, and women using acontraceptive pill, showed no significant preference for either symmetrical or asymmetrical men's scent.A separate analysis revealed that, within the set of normally cycling women, individual women's preferencefor symmetry correlated with their probability of conception, given the actuarial value associated with theday of the cycle they reported at the time they smelled the shirts. Potential sexual selection processes andproximate mechanisms accounting for these findings are discussed.

1. INTRODUCTION
A variety of evidence suggests that human female sexualdesires change across the menstrual cycle. Peaks in sexualdesire appear to occur most commonly during the mid-follicular or ovulatory phase (for reviews, see Hill 1988;Regan 1996). Increases in sexual interest prior to andduring ovulation may be specific to particular relationshipsor partner attributes. Baker & Bellis (1995) reported that,whereas the rate of British women's intra-pair copulations(IPCs) tended to remain fairly constant across themenstrual cycle (or even slightly increased during the non-fertile luteal phase), their rate of extra-pair copulations(EPCs) peaked during the last days of the follicular phase,a time at which fertility is maximal, with EPCs occurring ata peak rate about 2.5 times their rate of occurrence duringthe last week of the cycle (when fertility is low).These results are consistent with changes across thecycle not only in sexual interest per se, but also in preferences.Women may tend to prefer sexual relations with men whohave particular attributes during their period of peakfertility. One possible function of this shift may be a prefer-ence for phenotypic markers of genes that increaseoffspring viability during the fertile phase of the cycle.Although non-reproductive sex can have many functions(e.g. Hrdy 1981), 'good genes' benefits cannot be realizedunless conception occurs. Good genes sexual selection isan important form of sexual selection in a variety ofanimal species (partial reviews in Andersson 1994;Kirkpatrick 1996; Møller & Thornhill 1998b).For at least two reasons, olfactory perception is an appro-priate sensory modality within which to explore changes inpreference (see Kohl & Francoeur (1995) for a recent reviewof the role of scent in human sexuality.) First, whereas menrate visual information about, and odour of, a mate asequally important, women single out olfaction as thesensory modality that most affects their sexual responsivityand mate choice (Herz & Cahill 1997; see also Franzoi &Herzog 1987; Regan & Berscheid 1995). Second, evidenceindicates that women's olfaction changes across themenstrual cycle. One sexually dimorphic substance thatgives body odour a musky smell is 3o-androstenol (for areview, see Gower & Ruperelia 1993). Women's olfactorysensitivity to 3o-androstenol, and to related synthesizedsubstances, appears to be enhanced before ovulation andduring the mid-luteal phase (Vierling & Rock 1967; Doty1981; but see Amoore et al. 1975; Pause et al. 1996). Perhapsmore importantly, normally ovulating women evaluate arelated substance in human sweat, androstenone, morefavourably near ovulation (Grammer 1993). Although itremains unclear whether androstenol or other androgen-derived compounds signal male characteristics thatfemales value in mate choice (see Følstad & Karter 1992;Wedekind 1992), these findings provide a basis for exploringpreferences for male scent as a function of changes acrossthe menstrual cycle.Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is absolute deviation fromperfect symmetry on characters that are, on average,symmetrical on the two sides of the body (Ludwig 1932;Van Valen 1962). It is generally treated as a marker of developmental imprecision, the extent to which a geneticblueprint is imperfectly realized in an organism's pheno-typic development due to environmental and genetic perturbations (for a review, see Møller & Swaddle 1997).Meta-analyses and other literature reviews indicate thatFA negatively predicts fitness components such as long-evity, fecundity, and health status across a wide variety ofspecies (Leung & Forbes 1996; Møller 1997; Thornhill &Møller 1997). Moreover, a meta-analysis reveals that, onaverage, individuals with low FA experience greatermating success (Møller & Thornhill 1998b). Because FAhas a heritable component (Møller & Thornhill 1997a,b),good genes sexual selection may contribute to the greatermating success enjoyed by more symmetrical individuals(although other sexual selection processes may be involvedas well). In humans specifically, low FA has been shown topredict men's number of sexual partners (Thornhill &Gangestad 1994), facial attractiveness (Gangestad et al.1994; Thornhill & Gangestad 1994), number of EPC part-ners (Gangestad & Thornhill 1997), and number of timeschosen as an EPC partner (Gangestad & Thornhill 1997).Moreover, men's symmetry predicts the frequency of theirpartners' orgasms (Thornhill et al. 1995), which possibly isa means of cryptic female choice in multiple matingcontexts (see Baker & Bellis 1995).In this study, we examined women's responses to men'sbody odour as a function of men's FA and stagesthroughout the menstrual cycle. To do so, we asked mento wear T-shirts overnight for two nights. Women thenrated the attractiveness of the T-shirts' odour. Using avery similar protocol, Wedekind et al. (1995) showed thatwomen prefer the scent of men whose major histocompat-ibility genes differ from their own. We were interested inwhether women's preferences could also be predictedfrom men's FA, particularly for women who are in afertile phase of their ovulatory cycle.

2. METHODS
Forty-two men and 52 women participated in the study. Theirages ranged from 18 to 36 for men (mean=22.8, s.d .= 4.1) and 18to 52 for women (mean=22.6, s.d .= 3.4). Self-reported ethnici-ties of men were 67% Caucasian, 21% Hispanic, 7% Asian, and2% Native American (but one participant did not report hisethnicity); and of women were 52% Caucasian, 37% Hispanic,4% African American, 4% Native American, 2% Asian, and2% unspecified other. Neither men's FA nor the odour-attrac-tiveness ratings made by high- or low-fertility women (seebelow) varied across ethnicities, F4.35=0.31-1.04, all p>0.4,and therefore ethnicity was ignored in further analyses.

(a) Procedures for men
Men reported in groups of up to three for an initial measure-ment session. After reading and signing an informed consentform, each was given a brief questionnaire on demographic andother information (e.g. height, weight, sexual orientation, socio-economic status of family of origin). One at a time, they weretaken into an adjoining room, where the right and left sides often characters were measured using a digital caliper, sensitive to0.01 mm: ear length, ear width, elbow width, wrist width, anklewidth, foot breadth, and lengths of all fingers excluding thethumb. In previous samples (N>700), these characters havebeen shown to exhibit very little directional asymmetry and slight leptokurtosis, as expected of FA (Furlow et al. 1997; Gang-estad & Thornhill 1998b). To assess, and increase reliability, wemeasured each character twice.After the measurements had been taken and the questionnairecompleted, each participant was given a clean, never-worn, whiteT-shirt and provided explicit wearing instructions. Each was toldthat he should wear the T-shirt for a particular two nights (iden-tical for all participants) while sleeping. Each was also instructedto wash his bedsheets with unscented laundry detergent (providedby us) prior to those two nights and, during the two-day period,refrain from (1) using scented soaps, deodorant, or fragrance suchas cologne or aftershave, and instead use only unscented soap(which we provided); (2) eating garlic, onion, green chilli,pepperoni, pungent spices, herbs, strong cheeses, cabbage, celery,asparagus, yoghurt, and lamb; (3) drinking alcohol or usingrecreational drugs; (4) smoking tobacco; (5) engaging in sex withanother person; or (6) sleeping with another person. Each partici-pant was further instructed to place the T-shirt in a plastic bag(provided by us and identified with an arbitrary code number)during the day, when not worn, and return the shirt, in the bag,the morning following the second night at 9 a.m. Of the 42 parti-cipants, 41 returned their shirts on time.

(b) Procedures for women
At 10 a.m. on the morning that the men returned their shirts,female participants began reporting in groups of up to six.Following informed consent, women were placed in separaterooms. Shirts had been separated into groups of approximatelyten, and each group placed in a box. In addition to the 41 shirtsworn by men, one clean shirt that had not been worn wasincluded in the sample. Boxes were circulated through thesample of women present during a session. Some women there-fore smelled shirts 1-10 first, other women smelled shirts 11-20first, and still others smelled shirts 21-30 or 31-42 first. Althoughno attempt was made to fully randomize the order in whichwomen smelled shirts, it is likely that no two women smelledthem in precisely the same order. For each shirt, women wereasked to open the plastic bag, smell the shirt, and rate it onthree dimensions: (1) pleasantness, on a scale of 1 (very unplea-sant) to 10 (very pleasant); (2) sexiness, on a scale of 1 (veryunsexy) to 10 (very sexy); and (3) intensity, on a scale of 1 (notat all intense) to 10 (very intense). They were instructed to roll thetop of the bag shut before putting it back in its box and movingonto the next shirt. All researchers presenting shirts to women for smelling were unaware of the symmetry scores of the men whohad worn them. Women were not aware that the researchconcerned men's symmetry or their menstrual cycle variation.Women were also given a brief questionnaire to fill out, whichassessed the same background information we asked of the menin addition to two critical pieces of information: (1) whether thewoman currently used a contraceptive pill; and (2) the first dayof the woman's last menstrual period. We also asked women thetypical length (in days) of their menstrual cycle. Unfortunately,many women answered this question with the typical durationof their menstrual bleeding.In total, sessions lasted about 1 h. Sessions were run until noonof the day following the collection of the T-shirts.

(c) Data treatment: men
Multiple asymmetry measurements were checked forreliability. Intraclass correlations of the two measured signedasymmetries for individual traits ranged from 0.71 to 0.95: allF41,42 ≤ 5.80, p<0.00001; mean intraclass r=0.83. For unsigned asymmetries, these correlations ranged from 0.49 to 0.91: allF41,42 ≤2.93, p<0.0005; mean intraclass r=0.67.Signed asymmetries were checked for directional or anti-asymmetry (Palmer 1994). No right-left (RL) difference wassignificantly different from zero (all | t41 |≤1.54, n.s.). Nosigned asymmetry exhibited significant platykurtosis. Mean g2was 0.63 and hence distributions were slightly leptokurtic, consis-tent with FA (Gangestad & Thornhill 1998).To guard against the effects of large asymmetries due to injury,FA of traits that men reported to have injured were excluded inthese analyses if they were greater than the mean (18 out of 420observations; 4.3%). For measurement purposes, the mean FA forthe trait was substituted in these instances (r with unadjustedFA=0.96). This practice essentially treats high asymmetry oninjured traits as missing data by calculating FA on the basis ofthe uninjured traits (adjusted by the mean trait level of themissing trait).An aggregated FA score was calculated in two different ways.First, each trait's absolute asymmetry was divided by the meantrait size ((R + L)/2) for that participant, and the FA of all tencharacters was summed to yield an overall index (relative FA).Second, each trait's absolute asymmetry was standardized(divided by) the sample mean of trait size and summed to yieldan overall index (absolute FA). These two measures correlated0.99 with each other, and yielded nearly identical results (allcorrelations reported below to be within 0.02 of one another,with neither measure's correlations consistently higher than theother's). Thus, we report results for just one measure (the first)below. The intraclass correlation across the two measurementsfor the summed index was 0.65, F41,42=4.67, p<0.00001.

(d) Data treatment: women
Of the 52 participants, five reported a homosexual or bisexual orientation. Because this study examined attractiveness of scent in a heterosexual situation, analyses focused on the responses of the 47 exclusively heterosexual women. Of these, 17 currently used a pill or related contraceptive (e.g. DepoProvera) and one noted that she was post-menopausal. Of the remaining 29 parti-cipants, 28 provided a specific date for first day of their last menstruation. For these women, we estimated fertility risk (prob-ability of conception following sex on the basis of values reported in the medical literature (Jöchle 1973; illustrated in fig.=2 of Box 6.10 in Baker & Bellis 1995). The minimum value was=0.01, the maximum 0.40 (day 12). Nine women had a fertility risk of at least 0.15 (days 6-14). For convenience, we refer to this group as having 'high-fertility risk. Within it, the mean fertility risk was estimated to be 0.28 (range =0.18-0.40). The remaining=women had a mean fertility risk of 0.02 (range = 0.01-0.05). We=refer to this group as having 'low-fertility risk'. The mean cycle length of normally cycling women who appropriately responded to this question was 27.1 days (N=12, range=21-32). Three women reported to be on day 40 or more since their last menstruation, raising the possibility of pregnancy. Exclusion of these women did not alter the results.=The mean correlation between individual women's 'pleasant-ness' and 'sexiness' ratings was 0.82. Therefore, these ratings were averaged into a total attractiveness index for reported analyses.=Analyses on specific ratings yielded highly similar results.

3. RESULTS
We performed two complimentary sets of analyses. The first treated men as the unit of analvsis and examined associations between men's FA and mean scent attractiveness ratings by different sets of women. The second treated women as the unit of analysis and examined variations in how individual women's ratings were associated with men's FA.=Although unsigned FA tends to be non-normally distributed (Swaddle et al. 1994), Monte-Carlo analyses reveal that significance tests on parametric correlations involving FA are robust (Gangestad & Thornhill 1998a): hence, we performed standard parametric analyses.

(a) Individual men as the unit of analysis
For the first set of analyses, we split women into the two groups of normally ovulating women discussed above: high-fertility risk and low- fertility risk. Mean attractiveness ratings for each male's scent were calculated within each group. Each total index had a reasonably high internal consistency (a=0.75 and 0.79, respectively;Cronbach 1951), indicating that women's ratings tended to covary within groups. Our a priori prediction was that high-fertility risk women's ratings would correlate with men's FA and more so than low-fertility risk women's ratings. To control for experiment-wise error on multiple(2) tests, yet maintain sufficient power to test our directional hypothesis, we used a directed test and unbalanced Bonferroni-adjusted criterion values. Rice & Gaines(1994) recommend splitting the 0.05 p-value at 0.04 (for a predicted hypothesis and at 0.01 (for an unpredicted test).Adjusting for multiple tests in this way yielded criterion one-sided p-values of 0.032 (for the predicted negative relationship for high-fertility risk women) and 0.005 (for the unpredicted relationship in either direction for high-fertility risk women. The difference between the two correlations was tested with a directed test using a criterion p-value of 0.04 for the predicted direction (seeRice & Gaines 1994).Men's FA did not predict the mean attractiveness ratings of low-fertility risk women, r= -0.02, n.s. (d.f. =39). By contrast, men's FA significantly and negatively predicted the mean attractiveness ratings of high-fertility risk women, r= -0.31, p=0.023. Hence, the more symmetrical the male contributing the shirt was, the more attractive its scent to the high-fertility risk women. These two correlations significantly differed from one another, t(38)=2.72, p=0.005 (test for difference between dependent correla tions; Cohen & Cohen 1975).An issue that arises is whether the scent of symmetrical men is merely less repulsive to women during the high-fertility period of the cycle. Figure la shows the regression line of high-fertility women's mean ratings on men's FA.Also indicated is these women's mean rating of the clean T-shirt. As can be seen, the mean rating of the worn T-shirts' scents (4.64) was very similar to the rating of the scent of the clean T-shirt (4.50). The scents of about half of the shirts, then, were rated as more attractive than the scent of a clean shirt, which was rated slightly more negative than the mid-point of the scale (5.5). Figure 1b shows the comparable regression line for low-fertility women.Their mean rating of the worn shirts (4.76) was somewhat higher than their rating of the clean shirt (4.21).Low-fertility risk and high-fertility risk women's ratings were highly correlated, r=0.73, p <0.001. Clearly, then, a set of cues affected both sets of women is similar ways. Nonetheless, given the difference in correlation with men's FA, it appears that some variance in high-fertility risk women's evaluations was due to factors not affecting (or affecting to a lesser degree low-fertility risk women's evaluations. To examine the association between men's FA and variation in women's ratings unique to the high-ferti-lity risk group, we partialled low-fertility risk women's ratings out of the correlation between high-fertility risk women's ratings and men's FA. The partial r was - 0.44, p <0.005 (d.f. =38).Men reported the socio-economic status (SES) of their family origin on a five-point scale (5= upper class, 3=middle class, 1=lower class. Neither men's age nor their SES significantly correlated with men's FA (r=0.25 and -0.11, respectively, n.s.), the ratings made by high-fertility risk women (r-0.05 and 0.14, n.s.), or the ratings made by low-fertility risk women (r= -0.06 and - 0.02, n.s.). Partialling out men's SES and age resulted in a some. what stronger correlation between FA and scent attractiveness ratings made by high-fertility risk women (partial r= -0.33, p <0.05, d.f. =37). The partial correlation between FA and ratings made by low-fertility risk women was near zero (-0.01, n.s.).The internal consistency (a) of ratings made by women using contraceptive pills was 0.77. As expected, pill-using women's mean attractiveness ratings did not significantly correlate with men's FA, r= -0.16, n.s. This correlation did not significantly differ from the correlation between high-fertility risk women's ratings and men's FA at the 0.10 level (two-tailed; t3g=1.72, p=0.09), nor from the correlation between normally ovulating, low-fertility risk women's ratings and men's FA (3g=1.40, n.s.). On average, women gave the worn shirts an attractiveness rating of 5.02, compared to 4.68 for the clean shirt.

(b) Individual women as the unit of analysis
Because the above analyses could examine changes in women's scent preferences as a function of the menstrual cycle based only on rough and fixed categories of fertility risk, a second set of analyses treating individual women as the unit of analysis was performed. Each woman's attractiveness ratings were regressed on men's FA. The unstandardized regression slope that resulted reflected changes in an individual woman's ratings as a function of men's FA. Because a negative slope reflects preferences for the scent of symmetrical men, the sign of this regression slope was reversed to yield an estimate of preference for symmetry'.Normally ovulating (non-pill using) women's preference for symmetry was correlated with the estimated fertility risk based on the day in the menstrual cycle that the women had reached. We predicted that this correlation would be positive (and hence applied a directed test where the criterion -value =0.04; Rice & Gaines 1994).The correlation was highly significant, r=0.54, p=0.001 (d.f. =26). As figure 2 shows, the greater the fertility risk of a woman, the greater her preference for scent associated with male symmetry. The intercept of the least-squares regression line is nearly zero, meaning that women with no fertility risk favoured the scents of neither symmetrical men nor asymmetrical men. As esti mated fertility risk increased, however, women preferred the scents of symmetrical men. Owing to the fact that on most cycle days women have a near-zero probability of conception, fertility risk is a highly skewed variable. A randomization test (based on 50000 random pairings of the variables), which makes no a priori distributional assumptions (e.g. Thomas & Poulin 1997) yielded a p-value of 0.002.To examine whether pill-using women show the same changes across the menstrual cycle, we correlated their preference for symmetry with the fertility risk they would have were they normally ovulating, based on the day they had reached in their menstrual cycles. The results revealed no significant correlation, r= -0.09, n.s. (d.f. =12). These findings suggest that changes in normally ovulating women's preferences across the menstrual cycle are due to changes that take place in connection with normal ovulation, and not to changes that are entrained with menstruation independent of normal ovulation.To examine whether high-fertility risk women's ratings differed in mean level from those of the other groups, we performed an a priori comparison within a one-way ANOVA (e.g. Winer et al. 1991). Mean ratings by high-ferti-lity risk women (4.64) did not differ from those made by normally cycling low-fertility risk women (4.76) and women using birth-control pills (5.02), 442=0.88, n.s. No post hoc Scheffé comparisons were significant.

(c) Intensity ratings
On average, across women, intensity and attractiveness ratings correlated (r= -0.14): this value, although small, was significantly different from zero, t43=2.09, $ <0.05 (unadjusted for experiment-wise error).Because previous research has suggested that women's sensitivity to male scents varies across the menstrual cycle, we performed an a prior contrast between the mean intensity ratings made by high-fertility risk women (5.25) and those made by normally cycling, low-fertility risk women (4.77) and women using a contraceptive pill (4.37) (e.g. Winer et al. 1991). This contrast was not statistically significant (44 =1.58, p=0.12, two-tailed test).Men's FA did not predict mean intensity ratings for women in any group: high-fertility risk: r=0.08; normally ovulating, low-fertility risk: r=0.1l; pill-using: r=0.03; all n.s. (d.f. =39). Moreover, women's fertility risk did not predict the extent to which their intensity ratings reflected men's symmetry within the group of normally ovulating women; r=-0.05, n.s. (d.f. =25). Finally, within this same group of women, mean intensity ratings did not predict the extent to which their attractiveness ratings reflected men's symmetry; r= -0.05, n.s. (d.f. =25). Thus, partialling out mean intensity rating from the correlation between women's fertility risk and their preference for symmetry did not alter the correlation; partial r=0.54, p<0.01 (d.f. =24).Taken together, these findings suggest that the association between women's fertility risk and their preference for male symmetry is not mediated by a general increased sensitivity to smells during the fertile period. It should be noted, however, that a more objective measure of olfactory sensitivity may be needed to make this claim conclusively.

4. DISCUSSION
We explored changes in women's preferences for men's scent across the menstrual cycle. As predicted, normally ovulating women preferred the scent of symmetrical men during their period of peak fertility. Such women revealed no preference for symmetry or asymmetry during periods of low fertility. These findings are consistent with other literature (e.g.Baker & Bellis 1995) indicating that women's sexual preferences (e.g. as revealed by their rate of EPCs) change across the menstrual cycle. They are also consistent with the notion that the changes occurring during the period of peak fertility have been 'designed' by natural selection to increase the probability of insemination by a male who, relative to other males, provides genetic bene-fits. Such an adaptation could have been selected for in the context of multiple mating (e.g. an in-pair partner and one or more extra-pair partners). Baker & Bellis (1995) suggest that female orgasm also evolved in the context of multiple mating (through sperm retention, giving an edge to the sperm of certain men over that of others. Consistent with this logic, we reported previously that females are also more likely to experience orgasm (particularly high sperm-retention orgasm) with symmetrical men (Thorn-hill et al. 1995). Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that there exist female adaptations designed to bias insemination by males who provide genetic benefits in the context of multiple mating. Nonetheless, we cannot definitely rule out all alternative interpretations of the sexual selection process involved, and therefore the 'good genes' sexual selection hypothesis awaits further tests.For these findings to have occurred, women must be able to use a chemosensory signal in men's sweat or skin as a basis for discriminating between men who have and who have not experienced developmental instability.Because it would seem advantageous for all men (whether symmetrical or not) to signal developmental stability, the signal that women use to detect developmental stability in men's scent is presumably an honest one--i.e. asymme-trical men cannot fake it (Zahavi 1975; Grafen 1990). The current research does not address the precise nature of this signal. At least four possibilities may be entertained. (1) Androstenol levels may signal developmental quality (perhaps because of its association with other androgens such as testosterone or dehydropiandrosterone; see Kohl & Francoeur 1995). It should be noted that men's andros-tenol levels decrease with age (Brooksbank 1962), yet we found no effect of men's age on scent attractiveness in this study. Possibly, a larger age range is needed to detect any association. (2) The concentration or type of bacteria on the skin that contributes to male scent (e.g. Gower & Ruperelia 1993) may differ as a function of male developmental stability and its correlate, a sound immune system (see Thornhill & Moller 1997). (3) Symmetrical and asymmetrical men may produce different fatty acids in sweat (which contribute to its pungent odour; e.g. Gower & Ruperelia 1993), perhaps due to differences in metabolism related to men's symmetry (e.g. Manning et al. 1997).Perhaps symmetrical men produce acids with odours that are less aversive to women near ovulation than those produced by asymmetrical men. (4) Symmetrical men may have particularly rare HLA genotypes. Wedekind et al. (1995) found that normally ovulating women tend to prefer the scent of men who possess dissimilar HLA genotypes and, hence, men with rare HLA alleles should be attractive to relatively many women (see also Wedekind & Furi 1997). Future research should address these and other potential mechanisms.It should be noted that the scent of symmetrical men tended to be rated as near-neutral by high-fertility women, though still more attractive than the sweat of asymmetrical men, which was rated as aversive by these women. Hence, preference for symmetry may be owing to a lack of an aversive odour rather than the presence of a pleasant odour. Of course, any difference in pleasantness of odour could render a difference in female choice, as women might be expected to avoid sexual contact with men with aversive body odours. Hence, the presence or absence of an aversive odour could qualify as an important biological signal. Grammer (1993) found that women rate the smell of androstenone as near-neutral near ovulation, but as unpleasant during low-fertility periods of the menstrual cycle (consistent with the present findings), this being due to differences in production of andostenol or its derivative, androstenone. But the other possibilities we mention above are consistent with this aspect of our findings as well. One last note is that most women rated some men's odours on the sexy or pleasant side of the neutral point. Possibly, when a number of factors are all present (symmetry, HLA-dissimilarity, good hygiene), women find men's odours attractive. Because we did not measure all relevant factors (e.g. HLA similarity), we cannot address this issue with the present study. However, future work may address how these features work in concert to affect women's olfactory responses.
