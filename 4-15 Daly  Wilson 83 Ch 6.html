Sexual Selection: Mate Choice
Darwin distinguished between two processes in his original formulation ofsexual selection [137]. The first we have just considered at length: competi-tion for mates among the members of one sex, usually males. The secondsexual selective process is the exercise of mate choice, usually by females

CHOOSEY FEMALE, INDISCRIMINATE MALE
Throughout the animal kingdom males generally woo females, rather thanthe reverse. We saw in Chapter 5 why males are usually the more competitive sex and why they are concerned to maximize matings, while females arenot. Michael Ghiselin has aptly labeled this element of the male strategy"the copulatory imperative" [212]. As much concerned with quantity aswith quality, males are often rather indiscriminate in courtship, but thefemale's situation is different.There is a basic strategic difference between the sexes that demandsthat the female be more discriminating in her sexual responsiveness. Con-sider the consequences for each partner of participating in a bad mating,one that is unlikely to produce viable, fertile offspring. It is a bad mating,for example, if the mate is of the wrong species or suffers from a geneticallybased defect that is likely to hinder survival or reproduction. If a male in-dulges in such a mating, he wastes some sperm. Sperm are relatively cheap.The loss will not diminish his future reproductive possibilities should abetter mate appear tomorrow or next week or month. A possibility, albeitslight, that he will sire fertile offspring and perpetuate his genes is worth theinvestment of a few sperm, and natural selection should have inclined himto make that investment.The female is in a different situation. The penalty she incurs from abad mating is likely to be severe. Her great parental investment in each ofher potential progeny necessitates that she choose her mate well. Havingmated badly, her future reproductive possibilities are diminished. She maynot be in a position to accept a better mate should one present himselfsubsequently: Months of nurture may be committed to an inviable or infer-tile hybrid. As we might then expect, females are generally more selectivethan males in their choice of mates. Bateman was aware that the females aremainly responsible for maintaining reproductive isolation between relatedspecies of fruit flies. Males will court females of other species as readily astheir own. It is the females' task to check the males' credentials. Among in-vertebrates as diverse as butterflies and hermit crabs males are apt to courtan astonishing variety of objects, indeed almost anything that bears someresemblance to a female.In the vertebrates, with their more complex capabilities for perceivingand processing information, males are seldom quite so indiscriminatelyeager. Nevertheless, the task of fine discrimination and the prevention ofbad matings continues to reside mainly with the females, just as we wouldexpect from considering the differential penalties that such bad matings im-pose upon the two sexes. Naive male guppies, for example, are willing tocourt females of the wrong species, but even naive females will not acceptthe wrong males [382]. The males learn to confine their attentions to the appropriate females only by being rejected when they err. Females cannot afford to learn by trial and error, for the errors would be too costly. We couldcite further examples of the greater discriminatoriness of the female sex of various birds and mammals too, but it will perhaps suffice to note that theprinciple also holds up in our own species. Men are much more susceptiblethan women to misdirected sexual behavior, a subject that will be discussedfurther in Chapter 11."Choosey female, indiscriminate male" is of course a bit of acaricature, although it reflects a real asymmetry. Individual sperm are in-deed cheap, but whole ejaculates may not be [152], especially when theyconstitute a nutrient-rich "nuptial gift," as we shall see. And where malesmake a major parental contribution, as in most birds, a mismating can be asmuch a disaster for males as for females. In such cases, males have to be alittle choosey too [289]. Males also have to be somewhat selective whenthere is a significant time cost of mating. In isopods, for example, an orderof invertebrates including sowbugs, males often guard females from othermales for several days before mating, actually carrying the female about un-til she is ready to copulate. The males are then selective, preferring to guardlarger females who will produce larger numbers of eggs [413, 567]. But it isprecisely because the female is so often the scarce resource, valued andfought over by males, that she is frequently in a position to be more chooseyand to demand that her suitors assume at least some of the costs of thereproductive enterprise.

FEMALE CHOICE: MAKING THE MALES PAY
The black-tipped hangingfly is a slender predatory insect that hunts in thedense low foliage of temperate forests. Its prey consists of houseflies,aphids, daddy longlegs, and other small animals of the forest floor; and ac-cording to Randy Thornhill of the University of New Mexico [605], femalehangingflies prey upon arthropods of various sizes in proportion to theirabundance. Not so the males. When a male hangingfly catches a dead ar-thropod, he feeds on it only briefly and then does one of two things. A smallprey item he discards to look for another. But if the prey item is a certainthreshold size, the male everts a pair of abdominal glands and lets a specialchemical waft away on the breeze, the advertisement of a successful hunter.The target of the male's chemical signal is of course a female, andwhen she approaches, the male passes her the prey item (without relin-quishing his hold on it!) and attempts to mate while she feeds (Figure 6-1).If the prey item is inadequate, she breaks off copulation before any spermare transferred and departs. If it's a big juicy fly, on the other hand, she willpermit copulation to continue for the full twenty minutes necessary forcomplete sperm transfer. Once that goal has been attained, the malebecomes increasingly likely to break off copulation and snatch back his gift, which may still be good enough to win him another female! Meanwhile, hismate ignores advertising males for about four hours and goes off to layabout three eggs. Her egg production is to some degree a function of the sizeof the nuptial gift. Males are quite clearly buying fertilizations.The female hangingfly seems to have taken control of the matingsystem, and she lets the male serve her. When things are going well, shehardly has to hunt at all. Hunting is dangerous for these animals, for as theymove through the foliage in search of prey, they frequently run afoul oftheir major source of mortality-web-building spiders. And it is males, whotravel about twice as far as females, who mostly get snagged.So females with their precious ova are not quite such helpless victimsof roving males as might be imagined. They have their ways of makingmales pay. Thornhill [606] has reviewed a fascinating range of such transac-tions among the insects. In some species the male must provide a pro-teinaceous spermatophore, which the female assimilates, if his sperm is tobe accepted. The spermatophore may weigh up to a quarter of his bodyweight. In some flies, grasshoppers, and other insects, females feed uponglandular secretions from the male during copulation; if he stops secreting, she stops mating. Finally, it is not rare for the male himself to be consumedby his mate.Nuptial feeding is even more conspicuous in birds. Ornithologistshave long been aware that males feed females in courtship and duringnesting, but until recently little attention was paid to the energetic value ofthe gift. Courtship feeding turns out to be no arbitrary ritual [536]. Terns,for example, are colonially nesting birds who plunge-dive for fish andshrimp. In a fine study of common terns by Ian Nisbet of the MassachusettsAudubon Society [461], it was found that the rate at which males feed theirmates is maximal just when the energetic cost of egg production is maximal.Even more interesting was the fact that pairs varied in their nuptial feedingrates, and that the rate at which the male fed his mate was predictive of theweight of her clutch.In Chapter 5 we discussed some cases in which males can use two ormore alternative mating strategies (pp. 103-104). In such a case, the femalesmay prefer the male strategy that is most profitable for them, discrimin-ating against the alternatives. This is very clearly the situation in scorpion-flies (Panorpa), who are close relatives of the hangingflies and, like them,have been studied by Randy Thornhill [607, 608]. Like hangingflies, Pan-orpa suitors acquire a dead arthropod, emit a pheromone to attract afemale, and present it to her as a "nuptial gift." But when they cannot get asuitable prey item, male scorpionflies switch tactics. They secrete a salivarymass and advertise for a female in the same way they would with a prey.Male salivary glands are enormous-perhaps a quarter of the insect's totalweight-and their secretion is nutritious. So a male with no other nuptialgift to offer gives the female of himself. And there is a third avenue-rape.With neither a nuptial gift nor a secretion of pheromone, the male maysimply try to knock a passing female out of the air, immobilize her withspecialized claspers and clamps, and inseminate her forcefully. Males preferthe arthropod ploy-if you give them an arthropod, they'll use it and for-sake the alternatives. Without a prey, they'll use saliva if they can afford it.Rape seems to be a last resort. That the males would prefer to use a preyitem rather than their own saliva is not surprising, since salivary secretion isdebilitating. But it is less obvious why both advertising strategies are prefer-red over rape. It appears that this priority is female-enforced. Females fleefrom and resist males who attempt to use force, and they manage to escapeabout 85 percent of the time. They have a further line of defense too. In thelaboratory, Thornhill found that insemination was successful in all"honest" resource-transfer copulations, but was somehow blocked as oftenas not if the female had been raped. By discriminating against rapists, then,female scorpionflies selectively maintain a style of male courtship that of-fers them some material gain and some choice in who will inseminate them.In a few cases, the resources that male insects provide to females are so substantial that the male has evidently become a limiting resource forfemale reproduction, rather than the reverse. In the Mormon cricket (ac-tually a katydid), for example, the male provides a proteinaceous spermato-phore equal to 20 percent of his body weight. Unlike other katydid specieswith smaller spermatophores, female Mormon crickets fight over males,and males are coy and choosey [237]. We shall return to the subject of "sex-role reversal" in Chapter 7.

RESOURCE-DEFENSE POLYGYNY
A male can achieve some degree of polygynous monopoly by aggressivelyguarding several females. It's an exhausting strategy, and as we saw in thebison, a total monopoly is often not attainable, but female defense by adominant male can certainly pay off in a better-than-average number of fer-tilizations.But what if the females won't stick together? Simply being thetoughest male around may not be much help. As we have seen, males mayswitch to scramble competition when the females are not defensible. Thereis also a third possibility: Though the male may be unable to herd and con-trol the females, he can set up a territory in some place that females are sureto come to, and he can exclude other males. A steadily producing foodsource that will regularly attract mobile females may be worth defending.Hummingbirds, for example, feed on nectar, and a flowering bush may beguarded by a male who excludes other males while permitting females tofeed in exchange for copulations [691]. This is rather like the hangingfly'snuptial gift, except that the nectar source is stationary, and the male has noother claim to it than his ability to exclude others. In many insects, amphi-bians, and fish, ideal sites for oviposition or spawning are limited and aredefended by large, relatively successful males who are able to keep theirrivals at bay and fertilize the eggs of multiple females. Finally, where thereis post-zygotic care, as in all birds and mammals, females often establishtheir separate breeding sites close enough together for males to attempt todefend exclusive territories encompassing two or more breeding females. Itis this latter sort of territorial polygyny that we should like to examine in alittle more depth.

THE POLYGYNY THRESHOLD
Most migratory songbirds-robins and warblers and finches and so forth-are predominantly monogamous. A male establishes a territory, attracts asingle mate, and shares parental duties with her over the nesting cycle. But a minority of species-the ubiquitous red-winged blackbird of NorthAmerica is one example-are regularly polygynous. Individual males arecommonly able to attract two or three or four or more females to nestwithin their territories. Why? It would seem, from the arguments developedearlier, that males of any species might strive to accumulate multiple mates.If there is always an advantage to polygyny for the male, and yet it does notalways occur, then the circumstances under which it does occur must bethose in which there is also some advantage for the female. This, at least, isthe argument advanced by Gordon Orians in an attempt to explain thediversity of mating systems [473]. He elaborated upon the earlier ideas ofVerner and Willson [642], who coined the term "polygyny threshold."This concept is best explained with reference to migratory songbirds. Males arrive upon the breeding grounds in the spring before the females,and begin to sort out territories among themselves. Some males get choiceterritories, while others settle for poor ones. When the females arrive, eachsettles on the best available territory for nesting; in so doing, she inciden-tally picks a mate (though to what extent females may be influenced by themale himself is still unresolved; see p. 128). The consequences of variationin the quality of the territories are illustrated in Figure 6-2. Where the dif-ference between the qualities of available territories exceeds the polygynythreshold, as shown in the figure, a female will do better as a second mateon a good territory than as a first mate on a bad one. What makes a ter-ritory good or bad varies with the species in question and with the ecologicalcircumstances. It might be the availability of suitable nest sites or materials,of food for the nestlings, or of good conditions for the detection of ap-proaching predators. What is crucial is that territory quality varies in someway that the female can assess.The two curves in Figure 6-2 represent the cases of monogamy andbigamy. We assume that a female will fledge fewer young when bigamousthan when monogamous on a territory of the same quality because biga-mous females must share some resources, most notably the parental con-tributions of the male. (Hence, in species where the male contributesrelatively little, the curves should be relatively close together.) The curvesreach an asymptote because we assume that there is a ceiling on reproduc-tive success beyond which improvements in territory quality are irrelevant.Other curves could be added to Figure 6-2 to represent the cases ofthree females on a territory, four, and so forth. Territory qualities mightthen be such that the first female to arrive settles with male 1 and the secondwith male 2. The third becomes the second mate of male 1, the fourth joinsmale 3, the fifth becomes the third mate of male 1, and so forth. Each suc-cessive female picks the best available circumstance in terms of expectedreproductive success. This picture of a succession of female arrivals andchoices is consistent with Verner's observations of long-billed marsh wrensand with Orians's and Willson's of blackbirds.According to the polygyny threshold model, monogamy should resultwhen the curves are relatively flat (and/or relatively far apart) over therange of existing territories. More plainly, monogamy is expected where ter-ritory quality does not vary greatly, so that each arriving female will do bet-ter to accept the best remaining bachelor territory than to accept secondfemale status on a slightly better one. This suggests that those species ofmigratory songbirds that are regularly monogamous are not irrevocably sobut practice monogamy in response to particular ecological circumstances.This suggestion gains some plausibility from observations of occasionalpolygyny in a large number of species that are usually monogamous. Is polygyny in fact prevalent in those species where the variance inmale territory quality is especially large? Measurement of territory quality isdifficult, but there is some relevant evidence at a broad level of comparison.Ecological data suggest that marshes, which contain lush patches distrib-uted irregularly according to water depth and other variables, should behabitats with especially great diversity in territory quality. According toVerner and Willson [642], only 14 of the 291 species of songbirds nesting inNorth America are regularly polygynous and only 18 are marsh nesters ormarsh feeders during nesting, yet there are 8 species of polygynous marshusers. Polygyny is therefore far more prevalent among marsh users (44 per-cent) than among other songbirds (2 percent). This correlation is very im-pressive. However, in Europe, ornithologists have not found polygyny to beespecially prevalent among marsh nesters. The polygyny threshold argu-ment, that polygyny will occur where there is great variance in territoryquality, may still be applicable to the polygynous birds of Europe, with theavailability of suitable nest sites being the crucial and highly variable aspectof territory quality [238, 686].If females are really assessing the relative promise of availablebreeding situations and settling accordingly, and if they are at all accurate inthese assessments, then several predictions would seem to follow. The samemales who are the first to get a mate should also be the first to get a secondand a third (at least if females are reacting to overall territory quality andnot to specific nest sites). Females settling for successively less preferredbreeding situations should raise successively fewer young. And perhaps themost interesting prediction of the polygyny threshold model is that thoseopting for secondary female status should do just about equally wellreproductively as those who opted for monogamous status at the same time;in Figure 6-2, X1 = Z2. All these predictions have been neatly corroboratedin an exceptionally detailed study of lark buntings conducted by WandaPleszczynska [208, 503, 504].In the grassy Great Plains of North America the dramatic black-and-white male lark buntings make sure their presence is known, while thefemales are inconspicuous. (After marshes, grasslands seem to be thehabitat where songbirds are most often polygynous.) A rare virtue ofPleszczynska's study was that she was able to identify a simple measure ofterritory quality that proved to be highly predictive of both female prefer-ence and reproductive success. That measure was shade, for it seems that ashady nest site on the treeless plains is a precious commodity. Havingobserved that shade was related to female choice and to fitness, Pleszczyn-ska verified that the relationships were causal by adding plastic rosettes ofleaves to alfalfa plants in some territories; the effect was both to increasefledging success and to enable the lucky males on those territories to attract three females, something that never occurred in the absence of experimentalintervention! Male lark buntings, like so many other species, get their ter-ritories sorted out before the arrival of the females. By intensive observa-tion during the two-week period of initial female arrivals, Pleszczynska wasthen able to confirm each of her predictions (Figure 6-3).In those highly polygynous songbird species in which the male doesnot participate in parental care, our emphasis may be somewhat misplacedwhen we speak of females opting for a polygynous or monogamous breed-ing situation. In some populations of red-winged blackbirds, for example,males are never observed to feed young. The female's choice may simply bea matter of the best available nest site, with the male's mating status and ter-ritorial boundaries largely irrelevant to her. In fact, the local territorial malemay not even be the sire of all her young, although he probably sires mostof them [65]. But where the male contributes to the young, the femaleshould be more concerned with the distinction between being monoga-mously mated or polygynously mated. In several species of polygynous songbirds the male helps his firstfemale feed her brood but leaves any subsequent mates to fend forthemselves [e.g., 485]. Even so, a female may choose to become matenumber 2 on a fine territory while territorial bachelors are still available. Anexample is the bobolin: (Dolichonyx oryzivorus, Figure 6-4), a regularlypolygynous bird of North American pastures and cropfields that is in manyways reminiscent of the lark bunting. In a careful long-term study, StephenMartin found that the unaided second female had decidedly less reproduc-tive success than the assisted first female [414]. Second females laid 4.8 eggsper clutch and successfully fledged young from 49 percent of their eggs; thecomparable figures for first females were 5.5 and 64 percent, respectively.The lower success rate of the second females was clearly due to their lesserability to feed the nestlings without male assistance. That females continueto choose this second-female status over mating with remaining bachelorssuggests that their reduced payoff must still exceed what they could hopefor on the poorer territories, even with male help.

POLYGYNY AND FITNESS IN MAMMALS
There is some reason to doubt that the polygyny threshold model can be ex-tended to mammals without major modifications. The yellow-bellied mar-mot is a heavy, terrestrial squirrel that lives in subalpine meadows inwestern North America. In suitable habitat, marmots may be found inconcentrations ("colonies"), but the species is only moderately sociable.According to a study by Downhower and Armitage [164], adult males areterritorial and mutually antagonistic. The territory that a male defends encompasses one to four breeding females. As we would expect, a male'sreproductive output, measured by the number of yearlings produced, in-creases with harem size. However, female reproductive success declinessharply as harem size increases (Figure 6-5). Downhower and Armitage in-terpreted their results as contrary to Orians's notion that polygyny occursbecause of its advantages to females. Monogamy is clearly the best matingsystem from the point of view of the female yellow-bellied marmot, yetpolygyny exists. The usual harem size of two is a compromise, they sug-gested, between the still more polygynous inclinations of the male and thefemale's preference for monogamy.The argument has been criticized by Elliott, who doubts whether thelarge-harem female suffers reduced fitness [177]. The loss of fitness may notbe shared equally among all females. There is a dominance hierarchy amongthe females, and the senior female is not necessarily harmed by the presenceof the others. So it may be only the young females that do worse in bigharems than they would in a monogamous situation. Their present loss maybe compensated by improved survival prospects, resulting from thepredator-detection advantages the larger harems enjoy in comparison tomore isolated smaller groups. Elliott still favors the notion that polygyny must serve the female in order for it to have evolved. Nevertheless, thepolygyny threshold theory is decidedly less compelling in mammals than inmigratory songbirds. A terrestrial rodent like the marmot does not have themobility to visit all available male territories and thus make an informedchoice. Moreover, in some harem-forming mammals male coercion clearlylimits female choice. We have already described the male Hamadryas ba-boon that herds his females and punishes those who stray, and there are anumber of hoofed mammals that behave similarly. As Downhower and Ar-mitage quite rightly stress, the optimal reproductive strategies of a male andfemale are not perfectly harmonious, and there is no reason to suppose thateither mate will be able to achieve its own optimum in conflict with theother. The concept of a conflict of interests between mates will be developedfurther in the next chapter.The available human data on polygyny and reproductive success arereminiscent of the marmot findings: Polygyny costs the female and benefitsthe male. Among the Temne people of Sierra Leone, for example, an-thropologist Vernon Dorjahn found 54 percent of 246 married men to bepolygynous [161]. Men gained in fitness from increasing degrees ofpolygyny, while women lost (Figure 6-6). The decline in female fertility mayappear to be small, but it is statistically reliable and by no means trivial.Figure 6-6 shows that the reproductive loss in polygynous women has twoseparable components. The rate of live births declines, but only after theman has four or more wives. Infant mortality becomes a factor sooner. It ishigher at all levels of polygyny than in monogamous marriages-41 percentof children born to bigamous households died, an identical proportion inthe still more polygynous families, but only 25 percent in monogamoushouseholds.What are we to make of such data? It is tempting to suppose that theheightened infant mortality in polygynous Temne families is somehow dueto the reduced possibility for male parental investment in each offspring,but this is speculation. The phenomenon is all the more striking in view ofthe fact that it is the more affluent men who have multiple wives, and theyare presumably best able to contribute to their children's welfare.But is it at all legitimate to apply to such human data the kind ofstrategic considerations that we have discussed in relation to other animals?There are substantial pitfalls. The actual extent of female choice and malecoercion is difficult to assess, and there are more interested parties in a mar-riage contract than just the mates. Moreover, people have expressible inten-tions that often do not jibe with their "best interests" in terms of biologicalfitness. And their actual behavior may accord with neither! We shall discussthis further in Chapter 11, but for the moment an example will suffice. Itwould seem from the Temne study and other similar data that polygyny is contrary to a woman's reproductive interests. We might suppose that sheshould dislike the practice, but we could be quite wrong. Among the Iboand Yoruba of Nigeria, for example, it is (or was in recent times) slightlyhumiliating to be the sole wife, and lonely too [173, 650]. Monogamouswomen commonly encouraged or goaded their husbands to marry again. Itseems that a form of Elliott's argument applies here: The reproductive suc-cess of a senior wife is apparently not compromised by polygyny, whichmight even serve her interests by bringing in a helper [309, 628]. But weshould not be greatly surprised to discover, in any particular case such as this, that fitness is decidedly not maximized. People limit their reproductionin a multitude of ways, both deliberate and incidental to other goals. Anyspecies that includes substantial numbers of childless couples, exclusivehomosexuals, and religious celibates is sure to present some complicationsfor the evolutionist! How the theory of natural selection for reproductionmaximization remains relevant to the human animal is the subject of ourconcluding chapters.

FEMALE CHOICE:SHOPPING FOR GENES
If the females refuse to stay in a group, and the resources that females valueare too scattered or too ephemeral to defend, what is an aspiring polygynistto do? He might abandon his ambitions and settle down with one female,reallocating reproductive effort to parental investment; male parental careand monogamy are topics to which we shall return. However, this oftendoesn't seem like much of a solution. In a grazing antelope, for example, ora browsing grouse, neither a mother nor her precocious young has muchneed of a male hanging about. He can't feed them-the food doesn't lenditself to gathering-and he's probably likelier to attract a predator than tosuccessfully defend his family against one. Everyone would be happier if hewould just leave [697].In situations such as this, where the male provides the female withnothing other than a gamete, the female's best strategy seems clear. Sheshould pick the best gamete she can find, the set of genes that will best con-tribute to the fitness of her genes when united with them in an offspring.And this female strategy suggests what a male must do: propagandize.Without so much as a nuptial gift, the male's plight is like an old song lyric:"All I have to offer you is me." It's up to the singer to make that offer ap-pear attractive, more attractive in fact than the same offer being sung byevery other male in the vicinity.Whether females actually assess male genetic quality in choosingmates has troubled field biologists and theorists for decades. In territorial,polygynous birds such as the red-winged blackbird, many workers havetried to discover whether female choice is affected by both the territory andthe male or just by the territory alone. This is not an easy question to settle.The best males will generally hold the best territories, so one must somehoweliminate the correlation between the two factors if one is to separate theireffects. Experimental approaches are not necessarily successful, since theanimals may respond by changing positions or boundaries and reestablish-ing the correlation. There are some complex arguments in favor of thehypothesis that male quality is not altogether ignored [655, 701], but the effect of male quality upon female choice in resource-defense systems is stillunresolved.Where the male offers nothing but himself-that is to say his genes-the situation seems clearer. And the clearest such mating system is thatreferred to by the Swedish label lek. Males congregate at a fixed site, thelek, and display en masse while defending a small area each from the others.Lek sites commonly persist for many years. Females visit the lek, peruse theselection of strenuously posturing males, and choose in whose territory theywill tarry and be mated. Leks are used only for mating. No feeding occursthere, and the females depart quickly once serviced. These communaldisplay grounds may be conspicuous at great distances as a result of thespectacular displays of the assembled males. Lek systems occur sporadicallyin several bird families and in a few mammals, fish, and insects.In lek-breeding grouse [146], it has been demonstrated that the pre-ferred males are the oldest. A young cock must attend the lek for years withlittle or no sexual reward before he can move up to the status of a successfulbreeder (Figure 6-7). Each time one of the more central cocks disappears, the younger, more subordinate, more peripheral cocks jockey about tomove in a notch toward the charmed inner circle. (In other lek-breedingbirds, such as manakins, the most successful males do not necessarily oc-cupy territories near the geometric center of the lek.) What the hens seem tobe selecting for, then, is longevity with vigor. To reach the top a cock musteat well, dodge predators, stay healthy, win fights. And that is certainly nota bad set of attributes to pick on if one were aiming for an across-the-boardevaluation of genotypic quality.

BUT IS MALE QUALITY HERITABLE?
There seems to be no question that the males on a lek offer females nothingof value other than genes. And it has been abundantly verified that femalesare choosey-and highly consistent in their choices. Nonetheless, manybiologists hesitate to accept the conclusion that females have evolved to ef-fectively select the best male genotype. The argument against the gene-shopping interpretation of mate selection is a theoretical one. The lekmating system is one where the variance in male reproductive success islarge [e.g., 272, 347, 673]; visiting females evidently select males upon con-sistent criteria, so that a few preferred males get a huge proportion of allcopulations. Now, if every male is the offspring of a genetically superiorfather, then surely inferior genotypes must be rapidly eliminated by selec-tion. Recall that any trait that has been subject to selection is likely to have alow heritability (p. 33). How, then, can fitness itself be heritable? It wouldseem that the males on a lek are unlikely to vary much in their genetic fitnesspotential. According to this argument, variation in fitness must, for themost part, be environmentally induced, especially in highly polygamousmating systems, and if that is so, then females cannot use phenotypic cuesto shop for good genes.This objection has been raised by many leading theorists, but it can becountered both theoretically and empirically. The idea that fitness varia-tions must have only a minor heritable component is based on populationgenetical models with additive fitness effects of the genes at each of severalloci. Such models are indubitably oversimplified. As soon as one considersthat particular combinations of genes may have nonadditive fitnessbenefits, important genetic differences between males on the lek becomefeasible. And possibly even more important is the organism's overall levelof heterozygosity across all genetic loci. Considerable variability in in-dividual degrees of heterozygosity is to be expected, and there is evidencethat high levels of heterozygosity contribute to fitness; if a female wishes tomaximize heterozygosity in her offspring, she should mate with the mostheterozygous male available [61]. By choosing the oldest, most vigorous, or most dominant male on a lek, then, females may simply be managing thebreeding system to maximize offspring heterozygosity.A recent experiment confirms that selective mating can contribute tooffspring fitness. Linda Partridge of Edinburgh University [483] assignedfemale fruit flies to one of two conditions. The flies either mated in a groupsituation or in no-choice randomly constituted pairs. The group-matedfemales thus had the chance to mate with "better-than-average" males,whether as a result of the males competing or of the females choosing. Ifmale quality is heritable, this group-mating procedure should producebetter-quality offspring on average than the no-choice condition. Thecritical test pitted the progeny of the two sorts of matings in a competitivesituation against opponents of a standard strain. The result was that theprogeny of group matings were better competitors than those from no-choice matings. As Partridge concluded, "fitness may indeed be heritable."And that is an encouraging result, for if there were no such thing asheritable variation in male quality, then female choice, at the lek andelsewhere, would seem a meaningless charade.

RUNAWAY SEXUAL SELECTION
When Darwin first theorized that certain sexually dimorphic charactersmight be "sexually selected," he drew a distinction between thosecharacters of service in competition between individuals of the same sex(usually male) and those which served to attract members of the oppositesex (usually female). He remarked, however, that the same character-suchas horns or other male armaments-might be effective in both contexts, andthis is probably the general case. Effects of certain male attributes uponmale-male competitive success and upon female choice have been demon-strated empirically, but an intriguing question remains unresolved: Are anyof the traits that we observe utterly arbitrary products of a "runaway pro-cess" of preferential mate choice? As Sir Ronald Fisher [191] pointed out,preferential mate choice has a peculiar capacity to be self-reinforcing. Ifsome females find some arbitrary characteristic attractive-orange hair, say-then a rare orange-haired male will be on average a little fitter by virtue ofthis little attractiveness edge, all else equal. Well, as soon as there is a selec-tive advantage to orange hair, there is immediately instituted a selective ad-vantage for those who prefer it, since such females are likelier to haveorange-haired sons who will enjoy the fitness benefits of ... and so on. Asort of bandwagon effect ensues; nobody wants to be left out: Once mostfemales prefer orange hair, the sons of any female who does not conformare likely to be losers. Fisher felt that a runaway process of this sort wasnecessary to account for such "extravagant" display features as the cock pheasant's tail, and he verified that such a process was feasible with population genetical models.Fisher's formal analysis has been widely accepted and elaboratedupon, but many biologists question the importance of runaway sexual selec-tion in nature. If there are "real" differences in genetic quality between themales that court a female, then fancying orange hair would seem ratherfrivolous. "Extravagant" display characteristics are furthermore not justarbitrary differences like orange versus green hair-they are positivelycostly! The flight and foraging abilities of males who drag great plumesbehind them are compromised. Mightn't there be something more to thisthan runaway sexual selection? In 1975, Amotz Zahavi, a voluble Israelibiologist, suggested that the costliness of extravagant characteristics isprecisely their point: They are "handicaps" that are displayed to advertisetheir bearer's capacity to endure them [706].Zahavi argues his perspective in an informal, anthropomorphic style.A male with a huge tail, he suggests, is transmitting a message: "Look at theburden I bear! Can you doubt that I must be exceptionally nimble inavoiding predators, and skilled in gathering food, if I can afford to divertresources into such an absurd impediment?" Reaction to this argument hasbeen mostly critical-even hostile-but that reaction seems to be due moreto its style than to its content. Zahavi disdains formal models, and his flam-boyant translations of the messages in animal displays are easy targets fornit-picking. Several population geneticists have responded by constructingmodels in which a "handicap gene"-a mutant allele imposing a handicapand hence a fitness cost on its bearer-cannot spread by sexual selection.One leading theorist has set the handicap theory on the shelf with thisdeclaration: "I see little point in further discussion until it has been shownto work in at least one plausible genetic model" [424, p. 174]. It is notaltogether clear, however, that the genetic modelers approached Zahavi'sargument in the right spirit. The "handicap" is probably not best conceivedas an inevitable fitness penalty. It is a burdensome trait that is expressedonly in those individuals who can "afford" it [707]: "Look at the size of myantlers. I must be very vigorous to be able to support them." When the han-dicap principle is modeled in this way, then it is indeed plausible [181].

HONEST ADVERTISING
The point that Zahavi has been making is in fact more general than we haveyet indicated. It is that signal systems tend to evolve toward "truth in adver-tising." Suppose, for example, that females are concerned to choose themale of the best genetic quality. Any phenotypic indicator of male qualitythat they use to make that choice should be a valid one, or else females will be selected to ignore it. What is to keep a second-rate male from "faking"high quality? Females must choose on the basis of characteristics thatsecond-rate males are incapable of faking, and that would seem to meancharacteristics that cannot be produced cheaply. This is the sense in whichfemales should have evolved to prefer males with "handicaps." It is notthat the trait imposes a fitness cost on its bearer, but that it would impose alitness cost on a lesser bearer. The trait should thus be developed only to theextent of the individual's ability to bear it, and where this is true it will be anhonest indicator of quality.Honest advertising is to be expected outside the context of sexualselection too [e.g., 505]. Harris's sparrows, for example, exhibit variablewinter plumages-the higher a bird ranks in the dominance hierarchy of thewinter feeding flock, the larger is a black area of breast and head feathers.Lower-ranking birds give way to approaching dark birds, and the latter eatbetter and survive the winter better. The hierarchy seems to be maintainedwith little overt aggression. Why, asked Sievert Rohwer of the University ofWashington [533], don't low-ranking birds "lie"? Why don't they growmore black feathers and thereby improve their competitive standing? Tofind out, he dyed some low-ranking birds so that they appeared to bedominants, and you may have guessed the outcome. The dye job didn't dothem any good. The impostors were unable to make good on the bluff whenthey were aggressively challenged. The dominance hierarchy is generallymaintained without much overt aggression, but the relative rank of birds ofsimilar status is occasionally tested. And when advertising is then revealedto be false, the aggression persists and intensifies. Honesty seems to be thebest policy for a Harris's sparrow.Mate attraction displays ought to be similarly unfakable. Femaletoads, for example, have been shown to be attracted to the deep croaks ofthe largest males. The pitch of a croak is determined by the dimensions ofthe sound producer in such a way that small males are simply incapable ofmimicking big males' voices [139]. An almost identical circumstance hasbeen demonstrated in the red deer [105]. The hinds are attracted to theloudest, longest roars, and the volume and duration of a stag's roar arelimited by his chest capacity (Figure 6-8).It is again the lek mating system where the effects of female choiceought to be clearest-undiluted by male defense of either females them-selves or the resources that females value. When males strut and puff infront of a critical audience of potential inseminees, we must assume that it isthe females who have selected, over evolutionary time, for the strutting andpuffing. Why? It seems unlikely that females find malicious fun in makingmales look ridiculous! In a variant of honest-advertising theory that he callsthe "war propaganda" model, Gerry Borgia [61] has argued that femalesinsist that males on leks-and indeed territorial males in general-put on conspicuous displays in order to test the veracity of their claims todominance. The point is that displays attract the attention of rival males aswell as females, so that any male who has not established his dominancerank fairly through a history of male-male interactions will be challengedand found out.A clear example of just this sort of enforcement of honest advertisingis provided by some outstanding studies of brown-headed cowbirds byMeredith West and Andrew King [660]. In these brood-parasitic birds,females are induced to solicit copulation by male song. Dominant malessing more potent songs than subordinates, and one is immediately led towonder why anyone would sing a relatively ineffective song. The answer hasbeen provided by experiment. It is his competitors who ensure that a male'ssong reflects his true status. Isolate a male and his song will change overtime to a dominant, potent one. But return him to a competitive situationand the other males will attack him whenever he sings, although they will not attack an equally strange male if he sings a subordinate, ineffective song. Like the Harris's sparrow, the cowbird who advertises falsely ispersecuted mercilessly.An idea similar to the "war propaganda" model was advanced forelephant seals by Cathy Cox and Burney LeBoeuf, although in this case thefemale herself loudly draws attention to any male who may be bluffing highstatus [117, 118]. When a bull seal mounts an estrous female to attemptcopulation, she makes such a fuss that other bulls are attracted to challengehim, and it is then the most dominant male who generally ends up with thecopulation. Cox and LeBoeuf called this "female incitation of male-malecompetition" and the parallel to Borgia's "war propaganda" model shouldbe clear: Although in the one case it is the female and in the other the malewho raises the attention-getting ruckus, in both cases it is ultimately thefemales who are really insisting that the males' status be confirmed.Whatever one may think of the concept of "handicaps," then, Zahavihas drawn attention to a fundamental aspect of animal social behavior. In-dividuals are always striving to manipulate one another to their own fitnessadvantage, and propaganda should therefore be tested before it is believed.Fakable information is no information at all. Communication systems arelikely to evolve in the direction of honest advertising, not because honesty isa virtue, but because chronic lies and uninformative signals will come to bedevalued and ignored.

SUMMARY
Females are generally more selective in mating than are males, as is to be ex-pected since a mismating can cost a female much wasted nurture and lostreproductive potential.Females sometimes demand nuptial gifts from males in exchange forfertilizations, and they sometimes choose mates on the basis of territoryquality. In some cases, such as lek systems, females apparently select a matefor the quality of his genes.Females selecting mates, and indeed animals responding to any sort ofsocial signals, should evolve to attend only to those aspects of signals thatcannot easily be faked and are therefore truly informative.
