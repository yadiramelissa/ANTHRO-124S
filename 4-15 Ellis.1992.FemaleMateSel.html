The Evolution of Sexual Attraction:Evaluative Mechanisms in Women

BRUCE J. ELLIS

"For most sexually reproducing species all conspecifics of the other sex are not equally valu-able as mates: that is, they differ in "mate value." In many species selection has producedmechanisms to detect potential mates of high mate value. In other words, just as the taste offruit varies with food value, in a natural setting, sexual attractiveness varies with mate value." DONALD SYMONS

What do women find attractive in men? Many writers who have addressed this issuehave concluded that female preferences are so diverse and idiosyncratic as to defy sys-tematic explanation. I will argue, however, that general principles guiding female matepreferences can be discerned at the appropriate level of abstraction and that the evo-lution-based concept of "mate value" (Symons 1987a) provides a useful heuristic inthis endeavor.Men differ in "mate value." In reproductive terms, they are not equally valuableto women as mates (Symons 1987a). Consider, for example, a woman who can choosebetween two husbands, A and B. Husband A is young, healthy, strong, successful, wellliked, respected by his peers, and willing and able to protect and provide for her andher children; Husband B is old, weak, diseased, subordinate to other men, and unwill-ing and unable to protect and provide for her and her children. If she can raise moreviable children with Husband A than Husband B, then his "mate value" can be saidto be higher. Over evolutionary time, ancestral females who had psychological mech-anisms that caused them to find males of high mate value more sexually attractive thanmales of low mate value, and acted on this attraction, would have outreproducedfemales with opposite tastes. This differential reproduction would continue until suchmechanisms became universal and species-typical in women.This logic leads one to expect that a man's sexual attractiveness to women will bea function of traits that were correlated with high mate value in our natural environ-ment: the environment of a Pleistocene hunter-gatherer. Natural selection shouldhave designed evaluative psychological mechanisms (information-processing rules oralgorithms) in women that assess such traits and give rise to sexual and romanticattraction in response to them. In this chapter I review the psychological literature onmale sexual attractiveness in order to see whether women find traits that would havesignaled high mate value in our natural environment attractive in men.

SELECTION PRESSURES
The crucial question is, What traits would have been correlated with high male matevalue in our natural environment? Three possible answers are as follows:1. The willingness and ability of a man to provide for a woman and her children.Unlike males from most other mammalian species, who invest little in provisioningmates and offspring, human males can and do provide valuable economic and nutri-tional assistance to supplement what women can provide for themselves and their chil-dren. To the extent that males in the Pleistocene differed in their propensity and abilityto provision their mates and children, and to the extent that this variation was signaledby observable cues, selection would have shaped female choice to favor males whodisplayed such cues.2. The willingness and ability of a man to protect a woman and her children.Because of their smaller statureand lesser strength, women and especially children arepotential victims of violence from both humans and nonhuman predators. One valu-able kind of assistance males can offer their mates is protection from the negative actsof others, as well as from predation. To the extent that males in the Pleistocene differedin their propensity and ability to protect their mates and their children, and to theextent that this variation was signaled by observable cues, selection would have shapedfemale choice to favor males who displayed such cues.3. The willingness and ability of a man to engage in direct parenting activities suchas teaching, nurturing, and providing social support and opportunities. Many otheracts, aside from protection and provisioning, contribute to the well-being of one's chil-dren and their eventual successin reproducing. Providing one's children with knowl-edge and skills, intervening on their behalf in situations of social conflict, and generallyshaping conditions in ways that facilitate their health, growth, and success are dimen-sions of male behavior that would have had a powerful impact on a woman's repro-ductive success. To the extent that males in the Pleistocene differed in their propensityand ability to nurture their children, and to the extent that this variation was signaledby observable cues, selection would have shaped female choice to favor males whodisplayed such cues.

STATUS
Status refers to an individual's relative position in a social group; it is a measure ofwhere one stands among one's peers and competitors. Even in hunting and gatheringsocieties, status variations are substantial (Betzig, 1986; Lee, 1979). In general, thehigher a male is in status (i.e., the higher the level of esteem and influence accorded tohim by others), the greater his ability to control resources across many situations(Stone, 1989). Since control of positional resources is both a sign and a reward of sta-tus, natural selection could be expected to have favored evaluative mechanisms inwomen designed to detect and prefer high-status men. Forming mateships with suchmen could greatly enhance a woman's survival and reproductive potential through (a)elevation of her own social status, (b) immediate material and nutritional benefits, and(c) long-term access to social and economic resources. Thus, signs of current high status or future status-accruing abilities should significantly enhance female perceptionsof male attractiveness.

Economic Status
The importance of male status to female perceptions of sexual attractiveness is illus-trated by the lives of English tramps as described by George Orwell in Down and Outin Paris and London. These men lived a near sexless existence, not by choice, but byvirtue of their social position: They were at the very bottom of society and had almostnothing to offer females. That American men who marry in a given year earn about50% more money than men of the same age who do not is probably due in part tofemale choice for male resources (Trivers, 1985; p. 331).Many studies of female mate preferences have focused on the relative importancewomen place on a man's status versus his physical attractiveness. Ford and Beach(1951), in a cross-cultural survey of sexual patterns in nearly 200 small nonurban soci-eties drawn from the Human Relations Area Files (a collection of ethnographic mate-rials), document dramatic variations in cultural standards of sexual attractiveness,especially along dimensions of body weight and ornamentation. Yet, "one very inter-esting generalization is that in most societies the physical beauty of the female receivesmore explicit consideration than does the handsomeness of the male. The attractive-ness of a man usually depends predominantly upon his skills and prowess rather thanupon his physical appearance" (p. 94). Thirty years later Gregersen (1982) extendedand updated their account to include almost 300 societies, mostly from nonurban,non-Western cultures. On this subject, Gregersen's conclusion echoes his predeces-sors': "One generalization that can be made is that men are usually aroused more thanwomen by physical appearance. This would seem to be true whatever sexual orienta-tion is involved. For women the world over, male attractiveness is bound up withsocial status, or skills, strength, bravery, prowess, and similar qualities" (p. 186).Western empirical studies that have investigated the relationship between status,sex, attractiveness, and physical appearance have generally confirmed the conclusionsreached by both Gregersen and Ford and Beach. In a content analysis of 800 adver-tisements in the personals column of a national tabloid, Harrison and Saeed (1977)found that the three qualities women most often sought in men were, in descendingorder, sincerity (expressing concern about the potential partner's motives), age (want-ing someone who was older), and financial security. Women were more than twice aslikely as men to seek each one of these qualities, and women placed far more emphasison each of these traits than on physical attractiveness. Conversely, men were morethan three times as likely as women to seek "good looks." Cross-character assortment("coupling that is based on congruent elevation of different, but similarly valued, char-acteristics" [Buss & Barnes, 1986; p. 560]) occurred between the stated aspirations ofgood-looking women and well-to-do men, a common marital pattern in real life aswell: Physically attractive women are more able than less attractive women to parlaytheir assets into marriage with high-status men (Buss, 1987; Udry & Eckland, 1984).The relative effects of physical attributes and socioeconomic status (SES) onfemale perceptions of male attractiveness have been investigated by Green, Buchanan,and Heuer (1984) and Townsend and Levy (1990a). Green et al. reviewed the datingchoices of new members of a commercial dating service in Washington, DC, theGeorgetown Connection. The members read profile sheets on target persons and decided-on the basis of a photograph, open-ended statements about his or her goalsand interests, and demographic information (e.g., age, religion, occupation)-whetheror not they wished to date the person. In other words, target persons were separated,through selection, into two categories: "winners" (those who were chosen to be a date)and "losers" (those who were not). For male targets, the strongest predictor of winningwas higher status. Higher physical attractiveness was also a significant predictor. Forfemale targets, higher physicalattractiveness was the only significant predictor of win-ning. Joan Hendricks, president of the Georgetown Connection, commented:"Women really read over our profile forms, guys just look at the pictures" ("New Mat-ing Game," 1986).Various studies of dating behavior indicate that the physical attractiveness of apotential partner is very important to both sexes (Byrne, Ervin, & Lamberth, 1970;Walster, Aronson, Abrahams, & Rottman, 1966), especially in the initial phases ofcourtship. However, status plays an important role in early courtship as well. Town-send and Levy (1990a) investigated the relative importance of status and physicalattractiveness at six levels of romantic involvement, which ranged from having a cupof coffee together to willingness to marry. Photographs of people of high, medium, andlow attractiveness were paired with three levels of occupational status and income.College students viewed the different portrayals and indicated their willingness toengage in relationships of varying levels of sexual intimacy and marital potential withthe targets. Townsend and Levy found that partner's SES affected women's responsesmore strongly than men's at all six levels of intimacy and that this sex differenceincreased as the sexual intimacy or marital potential of the relationship increased.Partner's physical attractiveness also affected women's willingness to enter all six rela-tionships, but high status was able to equalize the acceptability of less physically attrac-tive men. Corroborative results were obtained in a similar experiment by Hickling,Noel, and Yutzler (1979).The importance of male economic status has also been studied cross-culturally aspart of the International Mate Selection Project (IMSP), which investigated mate pref-erences in 37 cultures spread over six continents and five islands (N = 9,474). Subjectsrated 18 mate characteristics on desirability. In 36 of the 37 samples, women placedsignificantly more value on "good financial prospect" than men did, and, overall,females valued "good financial prospect" more highly than "good looks" (Buss,1989a; Buss et al., 1990).In summary, cross-cultural ethnographic reports, cross-cultural empirical studies,laboratory studies on mate choice, the analysis of personal advertisements, and anexamination of decisions made at a major commercial dating service coalesce on thispoint: Status and economic achievement are highly relevant barometers of maleattractiveness, more so than physical attributes.

Ornamentation
"The study of clothes exhibits in a pure form the pursuit of status," Quentin Bell(1976, p. 17) concludes in hisdefinitive work on the subject. "The mere fact that sopurely social a consideration as the class structure of a society can to so great an extentdetermine our aesthetic feelings must give us pause and make us wonder how our valuejudgments are arrived at" (p. 185).That people use clothes to assess class background has been convincingly demonstrated in a variety of field experiments (Molloy, 1975). If evaluative mechanismsin women were designed to detect and prefer signs of high status in men, then style ofdress should provide a powerful cue to male attractiveness. Women can be expectedto possess adaptive mechanisms that specify a rule such as, "Prefer ornamentation thatsignals high status in my culture."Townsend and Levy (1990b) investigated the effects of male status on female will-ingness to engage in various romantic relationships. Male targets were prerated forphysical attractiveness and divided into two categories: handsome and homely. Thesemodels, shown in 35 mm slides projected on a screen, wore one of three costumes: adesigned blazer with a Rolex watch (high status), a plain white shirt (medium status),or the uniform of a Burger King employee (low status). The high-status models weredescribed as physicians, the medium-status models were described as high schoolteachers, and the low-status models were described as waiters-in-training. Both under-graduates and law students viewed the slides and stated their willingness to engage inrelationships with the different models at six levels of romantic involvement, rangingfrom casual conversation to dating, sex, and marriage. Townsend found that womenwere significantly more willing to engage in liaisons with the high-status/homely malesthan with either the medium- or low-status/handsome males at all six levels of sexualintimacy and marital potential. (In contrast, male subjects always preferred handsomefemales over homely females, regardless of costume, ascribed occupational status, ortype of relationship proposed.)Hill, Nocks, and Gardner (1987) manipulated physique and status displays byaltering clothing tightness and skin exposure on the one hand, and styles of dress rep-resentative of different socioeconomic classes on the other. College students ratedopposite-sex models in the various physique and status conditions on four differentscales of attractiveness: physical, sexual, dating, and marital. In the low-physique con-dition, which deemphasized body form, women found high-status male dressers moreattractive than low-status ones on all four scales. In the more provocative high-phy-sique condition, which revealed more skin and accentuated body form, women foundboth high-status and low-status male dressers equally unattractive (each received lowratings on all four scales). Overall, high-status dress strongly inflated male attractive-ness, whereas a high degree of body exposure markedly deflated it. (In appraisingwomen, men found females in high-physique displays more attractive on the dating,sexual, and physical scales, but less attractive maritally.)Although the basic result of this study-that high-status cues enhance male attrac-tiveness-is clear, its details are difficult to interpret because of a possible methodo-logical oversight: Hill, Nocks, and Gardner did not test to see whether physique andstatus displays were independent dimensions. Given that other studies have found thatwomen do value physical attractiveness in men (Byrne, Ervin, & Lamberth, 1970;Walster et al., 1966), the fact the high-physique display almost completely negated thepositive effect of the high-status display suggests that tight clothing and skin exposureare cues of low male status for their subject population (American university women).As stated above, style of dress is highly indicative of status; sexual advertising in maleattire-even when swathed in designer labels -- may connote low class, just as drabgray suits may connote high class and resource control. Unfortunately, this hypothesiscannot be tested using Hill, Nocks, and Gardner's data, because they did not obtainstatus ratings on high- versus low-physique displays while holding other status cuesconstant.

Dispositional Characteristics
If women's evaluative mechanisms were designed to detect and prefer characteristicsassociated with high status, then females should favor males with indicative cognitiveabilities and personality traits. Relevant data were collected in a recent study on matepreferences in 6,000 American couples, including heterosexual and homosexual, mar-ried and cohabitating pairs (Howard, Blumstein, & Schwartz, 1987). Mate preferenceswere assessed via a factor-analyzed 14-item list of attributes that respondents rated ona 1-to-9 scale (1 = not at all important, 9 = extremely important). The factor ambi-tiousness-including the individual items "accomplished," "ambitious," "self-suffi-cient," and "outgoing"-emerged as a major dimension of female preference with amean value of 6.24. Subsequent investigations of the IMSP have tended to corroboratethis finding. The IMSP employed two standardized closed-form questionnaires. Sam-ples were drawn from all parts of the world and represent a tremendous racial, ethnic,political, and religious diversity. As part of this project, Buss et al. (1990) examinedmate characteristics suggestive of resource control or likely acquisition. Using a 0-to-3 scale (0 = irrelevant, 3 = indispensable), subjects rated "education and intelligence"and "ambition and industriousness" on importance and/or desirability in choosing apartner. Collapsed across the 37 samples in the international study, female subjectsgave these characteristics mean scores of 2.45 and 2.15, respectively. These high rat-ings suggest that intelligence, the will to succeed, and the tendency to work hard arequalities strongly and universally desired by women.

Willingness to Invest
The female tendency to favor high-status males is only one part of the constellation ofevaluative mechanisms expected to underlie mate choice in women. Selection shouldalso have favored mechanisms in females designed to detect and prefer males who werewilling to convert status and ability into paternal assistance. Fathers who are nurtur-ant, as well as emotionally and economically supportive of their wives, encourage thedevelopment of achievement motivation, intellectual and social competence, psycho-logical adjustment, and sex-typical attitudes and attributes, particularly in sons(Lamb, 1981). All else equal, therefore, women should find men who demonstrate thewillingness to devote time and resources to a chosen female and her offspring moreattractive than men who do not.Recent large-scale attempts to identify major dimensions of preference in mateselection both in the United States (Howard, Blumstein, & Schwartz, 1987) and cross-nationally (Buss et al., 1990) indicate that women want someone they like and candepend on. In the study by Howard et al. (described above), the factor expressive-ness-including the individual items "affectionate," "compassionate," "expressesfeelings," and "romantic" -- was by far the strongest female preference with a meanvalue of 7.34 on a 9-point scale. Buss et al. assessed mate preferences via an 18-itemlist of attributes that respondents rated on a 0-to-3 scale (0 = irrelevant, 3 = indis-pensable). Collapsed across the 37 samples in the IMSP, female subjects gave the fol-lowing characteristics the highest ratings: mutual attraction-love (2.87), dependablecharacter (2.69), emotional stability and maturity (2.68), and pleasing disposition(2.52). At least in these questionnaire studies, the most important qualities womensought in their mates were mutual attraction, stability, dependability, compatibility, and expressiveness. In other words, women seemed to be looking for the kind of menwho would make good, willing fathers.It is frequently observed that women are especially attracted to men they see play-ing nicely with young children (e.g., Remoff, 1984). This attraction appears to havenothing to do with the desire per se to have children; rather, it is autonomous. Thedesirability of men who show fondness for children has been documented empirically(Buss & Barnes, 1986), and further investigations are under way.

Structural Powerlessness
Many social scientists (e.g., Coombs & Kenkel, 1966; Hill, Rubin, & Peplau, 1979;Murstein, 1980) have attributed sex differences in the bases of sexual attraction tosocial conditioning and men's and women's differential access to power: Becausewomen lack power, they seek in men those characteristics associated with power suchas status, security, and control of resources. The primary channel for a woman to moveupward in society is to marry upward in SES; hence her life chances are largely deter-mined by the job performance of her husband. Since his occupational success dependsso much on his skills and personal qualities (such as industriousness and ambition),she must choose him carefully, rigorously assessing his merits and potential. Accord-ing to this theory, men do not experience the same kinds of structural constraints and,therefore, do not experience the same kinds of needs and desires. Men concern them-selves with cosmetic qualities because sex is the main reward males seek in a relation-ship. Social conditioning, it is posited, maintains and reinforces the whole process,inculcating sex-role-appropriate values from generation to generation. Buss andBarnes (1986; p. 568) call this theory the "structural powerlessness and sex role social-ization" hypothesis and note that it does not address "the question of the origins of sexrole socialization practices and of the existing economic power structure." Nor does itexplain the transcultural nature of sex differences.The structural powerlessness hypothesis has led various social theorists to makethis testable prediction: Women with access to power and wealth will act and fee sex-ually more like men (much the same as men, in fact) than women who are compara-tively powerless and poor (see Dion, 1981; Rosenblatt, 1974; Murstein, 1980).Women, it is predicted, will become less sexually selective and less interested in thesocioeconomic status of their mates as their own independence and socioeconomicpower increases. (To my knowledge no one has suggested that men will become moreselective and more concerned with personality and economic factors as their own sta-tus decreases, but this would be another implication of the theory.) In contrast, mostevolutionary psychologists would predict that women will prefer high-status matesregardless of whether a female is herself low or high status.The structural powerlessness hypothesis is directly contradicted by available data.Interview studies of both medical students and leaders in the women's movementreveal that women's sexual tastes become more, rather than less, discriminatory astheir wealth, power, and social status increases. Fifteen feminist leaders, when askedwhat traits they sought in a man, recurrently used words that connote high status:"very rich" or "brilliant" or "genius." Lavish dinners, large tips, stunning suits, andso forth were regularly referred to. In short, these high-power women wanted super-powerful men (Fowler, cited in Freedman, 1979). Townsend (1987, 1989), in an inves-tigation of second-year medical students at a northeastern university, found that female medical students often became "more selective and critical in entering andmaintaining sexual relationships than they had been previously. Time spent in a rela-tionship that had no marital potential was seen as time wasted." In contrast, malemedical students were convinced that their increasing status would allow them to"seek and enjoy more transitory relationships in the future and such a course wouldbe less damaging to their mental balance and career aspirations than would moreinvolved relationships" (Townsend, 1987, pp. 440-441). For females, increasing SESmarkedly reduces the pool of acceptable romantic partners for this reason: Women,in medical school as in general, want men who are at least on a par with their ownsocioeconomic level, regardless of how high that level is (Blumstein & Schwartz, 1983;Goldman, Westoff, & Hammerslough, 1984; Townsend, 1987, 1989; Udry, 1981).These findings concur with those of Buss (1989b, p. 41), who found that "women whomake more money tend to value monetary and professional status of mates more thanthose who make less money."The evidence suggests that the female tendency to favor high-status males is not asocial construct arising from context-dependent needs or women's lack of power.Rather, it suggests that the female preference for high-status males is the product of apsychological mechanism that operates whether a woman's own SES is high or low.

PHYSICAL DOMINANCE
Dominance is a measure of one individual's ability to prevail over another in com-petitive encounters that involve a face-to-face physical component, whether implicitlyor explicitly. It is a means of obtaining a resource that involves imposing or threateningto impose a cost on one's competitor. The higher a male is in dominance (i.e., thegreater his ability to displace others through coercion from positions or commoditicsthey both want), the greater his access to a variety of fitness-enhancing resources.Alexander (1987) suggests that the primary "hostile force of nature" encounteredby humans is other humans. In this view of the world, conflicts of interest are perva-sive, and the competitive strivings of conspecifics become the most salient feature ofour adaptive landscape. A man's ability to traverse this landscape, successfully pre-venting others from violating his interests, depends substantially on his reputation andability to maintain a favorable position in dominance hierarchies. Because competi-tion is ubiquitous, and because socially dominant males (by definition) tend to farebest in face-to-face competitive encounters, natural selection can be expected to havedesigned evaluative mechanisms in women to detect and prefer high-dominance men.Forming mateships with such males could substantially enhance a female's survivaland reproductive potential through (a) his ability to retain resources that he has or toexpropriate resources from others, (b) protection from conspecifics who might other-wise harm, intimidate, or supplant her and her children, and (c) elevation of her owndominance ranking, which would increase her ability to prevail over others.Hinde(1978) distinguishes two kinds of dominance: dyadic and group. The formerrefers to the pattern of imbalance within a relationship between two people; the latter,to the pattern of rank within a larger group structure. Hinde argues that these twoforms of dominance are not necessarily related. This distinction is relevant here in thatthere is no a priori reason to predict that women will be sexually drawn to men whowill dominate them in dyadic relationships. Rather, it is the male's ability to successfully negotiate the larger social hierarchy that should be attractive to females. Womenpay close attention to how men interact with and are treated by other men (cf. Sadalla,Kenrick, & Vershure, 1987). And the importance of these interactions and the systemsof dominance that emerge from them should not be underestimated. As Daly and Wil-son (1988, p. 128) point out, "men [become] known by their fellows as 'the sort whocan be pushed around' or 'the sort who won't take any shit,' as people whose wordmeans action or people who are full of hot air, as guys whose girlfriends you can chatup with impunity or guys you don't want to mess with."In summary, evolutionary considerations lead one to expect that women will besexually attracted to men who display traits that are reliably correlated with socialdominance. Bernstein (1980) divides these traits into three categories: (a) physicaltraits, such as size and physiognomy; (b) social traits such as kinship relationships andpolitical alliances; and (c) individual behavioral traits, such as self-confidence, bodylanguage, and aggressiveness. The traits in the first category should constitute less psy-chologically central mate selection criteria for women than the traits in the second andthird categories: While size and strength can contribute to dominance, social standingand body language signal what rank a person has actually achieved within a domi-nance hierarchy. For example, even a very large man may act submissive if he findshimself among giants, or among the more clever, agile, aggressive, or socially powerful.His behavioral acts (such as patterns of gesturing and deference) will reveal his realposition. Nonetheless, insofar as morphological traits were associated with dominancein the Pleistocene, they should still have an impact on female perceptions of maleattractiveness today.Ideally, in an investigation of the effects of dominance on sexual attractiveness, onewould look at all major traits in Bernstein's three categories and manipulate them inan experimental setting. High and low self-confidence, high and low physical strength,high and low political connectedness, etc., would each be used as independent vari-ables, and their effect on subjects' ratings of the sexual attractiveness of target stimuliwould be measured. Unfortunately, careful studies of this kind have been done on onlya small set of traits, all of which fall into the first or third categories. Hence, the follow-ing review of dominance and sexual attractiveness will include only these categories.

Individual Behavioral Traits
High-Dominance Personality
The relationship between personality and "leadership," or "managerial effectiveness,"has been studied extensively (e.g., Bentz, 1967; Campbell, Dunnette, Lawler, & Weick,1970; Ghiselli, 1971; Lord, De Vader, & Alliger, 1986; Stodgill 1974), and althoughthe relationship has proven complex and does not easily lend itself to exact interpre-tation, some clear trends have emerged. A number of U.S. companies have conductedcognitive and personality assessments on their employees, and these assessments havedemonstrated reliable covariation between certain personality variables and ratedmanagerial ability. In specific, those individuals who rise to the top of organizationstend to be bright, initiating, self-assured, decisive, masculine, assertive, persuasive, andambitious (Bentz, 1967; Campbell, Dunnette, Lawler, & Weick, 1970; Ghiselli, 1971;Lord, De Vader, & Alliger, 1986; Stodgill, 1974). As Bentz (p. 118) concludes, "a clus-ter of psychological characteristics contributes to general executive competence thattranscends the boundaries of specialized or non-specialized assignments." This cluster closely coincides with the description of the dominant personality that emerges fromthe California PsychologicalInventory Dominance scale, which was designed to assessfactors of dominance, persistence, leadership ability, and social initiative and hasproven to be an effective measure of leadership potential (Gough, 1969; Megargee,1972). Gough, McClosky, and Meehl (1951, p. 362) describe a high score on this scale:

  A careful reading of the items suggests a number of characterizations of the subjective sideof the dominant personality. The factor which is implied by the largest number of itemsappears to be one of poise and self-assurance. The dominant personality maintains a highlevel of self-confidence, does not seem to be plagued by self-doubts or equivocations, andtherefore appears freer to behave in an unencumbered and straightforward manner. Theimpression given is one of resoluteness and vigorous optimism. Closely related to this isanother suggested factor of resourcefulness and efficiency. The dominant personalityappears to move forward ina realistic, task-oriented fashion and manifests feelings of ade-quacy in meeting whatever obstacles may be encountered.There is also a certain element of perseverence, or even doggedness, implied. The dom-inant subjects admit to working on at things even when others become impatient with them,etc., and in general give evidence of strong completion needs.

According to the selectionist model, women should rate men who display these char-acteristics more favorably on measures of sexual and romantic attractiveness thanmen who do not.Preliminary work on therelationship between personality and mate preferences isunderway. Most relevant to this discussion are potential correlations between attrac-tiveness and surgency (a major personality factor combining aspects of dominanceand extroversion). Surgency has emerged as one of the most common and replicabledimensions in personality taxonomies (e.g., Goldberg, 1981; Norman, 1963; Wiggins,1979). High scores on surgency are strongly correlated with a wide array of hierarchynegotiation tactics (Kyl-Heku & Buss, n.d.), and, consistent with evolutionary predic-tions, high scores on this dimension are especially prized by women in potential mates(Botwin & Buss, n.d.). Whereas the extroversion dimension of surgency is equally val-ued by both sexes in prospective partners, the dominance dimension comprisingpower and social ascendanceis far more valued by women than men (Botwin & Buss,n.d.)These data fall in line with the findings of Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure (1987),who manipulated levels of competitive dominance-seeking behavior in an experimenton dominance and heterosexual attraction. Targets were described as participants inan intermediate tennis class who, despite limited training, were very coordinated play-ers and won 60% of their matches. In the high-dominance condition, the target was described as follows:

  His serve is very strong and his returns are extremely powerful. In addition to his physicalabilities, he has the mental qualities that lead to success in tennis. He is extremely compet-itive, refusing to yield against opponents who have been playing much longer. All of hismovements tend to communicate dominance and authority. He tends to psychologicallydominate his opponents, forcing them off their games and into mental mistakes.

In the low-dominance condition:

  His serve and his returns are consistent and well placed. Although he plays well, he prefersto play for fun rather than to win. He is not particularly competitive and tends to yield to opponents who have been playing tennis much longer. He is easily thrown off his game byopponents who play with great authority. Strong opponents are able to psychologically dom-inate him, sometimes forcing him off his game. He enjoys the game of tennis but avoidshighly competitive situations.

Each sex read and rated descriptions of opposite sex targets. Both males and femalesin the high-dominance condition were rated significantly higher on the followingtraits: strong, hard, rugged, tough, cold, intelligent, high income, high status, and mas-culine. Also, dominant males were rated far higher on sexual attractiveness and datingdesirability than nondominant males. (Dominance manipulations had no effects onratings by males of female targets on these dimensions.) These findings suggest thathigh-dominance personality descriptions markedly enhance female perceptions ofmale eligibility.High-dominance males in the Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure study were ratedconsiderably more sexually attractive, but significantly less warm, likable, and ten-der-qualities that presumably offer cues to a male's willingness to invest in a womanand her children (see Buss, this volume). Does this mean that the very qualities thatmake up the ability to invest (e.g., high dominance, achievement of status) stand inopposition to qualities that indicate willingness to invest?The solution to this apparent paradox may lie in the fact that broadly wordeddescriptors such as "kind" or "dominant" do not capture crucial, context-specific vari-ation in behavior. For example, women may find "generosity" appealing in a man(Remoff, 1984), but presumably a woman wants a man who is generous with her butnot with her reproductive competitors. Similarly, she may want a man who is domi-nant (and therefore less "warm, likable, and tender") when he is in competition withother men, but who is warm, likable, and tender toward her. This could be tested byasking subjects to rate how individuals in the high- and low-dominance conditions arelikely to behave in other social contexts.

Body Language
Dominance is signaled in day-to-day life through a variety of nonverbal gestures rec-ognizable cross-culturally. In comparison to high-dominance people, low-dominantssmile more often (a gesture of appeasement), are less likely to infringe on another'spersonal space, and are more likely to look away from the gaze of others, eyes downcast(Maclay & Knipe, 1972; see also Mehrabian, 1969; Weisfeld & Beresford, 1982).Whereas submissives tend to exhibit a drawn-in, slouching posture, dominants tendto have an upright bearing, shoulders straight and head thrown back, and to move witha general ease and freedom of body movements (Maclay & Knipe, 1972), communi-cating a sense of calm and self-assurance. According to evolutionary predictions, thesedominance gestures (when directed at other men) should affect female perceptions ofmale sexual attractiveness, with high-dominance gestures preferred.Sadalla, Kenrick, and Vershure (1987) made silent videotapes depicting men andwomen engaging in either high-dominance or low-dominance behavior. Each actorplayed a high-dominance role in one tape and a low-dominance role in another. Allvideotaped interactions took place between two members of the same sex. Sadalla etal. describe the two scenes:

	In the low-dominance condition, a constant male (CM) is shown seated at a desk in an office.An actor enters the room and chooses a chair near the door. ... The actor, clutching a sheath of papers, sits in a symmetrical posture, leans slightly forward with head partially bowed,and alternately looks down at the floor and up at the CM. During an ensuing discussion, theactor engages in repetitive head nodding and lets the CM engage in longer communications.In the high-dominance condition, the actor enters, chooses a chair closer to the CM andsits in a relaxed, asymmetrical posture. The actor's hands and legs are relaxed and his bodyis leaning slightly backward in the chair. During the discussion, the actor produces higherrates of gesturing and lower rates of head nodding than in the low-dominance condition.

Male subjects viewed female actors, and female subjects viewed male actors. Both menand women in the high-dominance condition were rated by subjects significantlyhigher on traits such as strong, hard, rugged, tough, and masculine. The participantsalso judged target persons on sexual attractiveness and dating desirability. High-dom-inance behavior significantly increased ratings of male targets on both measures. Rat-ings of female targets were unaffected. These data suggest that female experiences ofsexual and romantic attraction are sensitive to nonverbal displays of male dominanceand that this sensitivity is characteristic of female sexual psychology but not male sex-ual psychology.

Physical Traits
Physiognomy
Perceptions of social dominance in humans, as well as in nonhuman animals, areaffected by physiognomic traits. In particular, traits associated with physical maturity(proportionately thin lipsand eyes, receding hairline) and physical strength (wide face,square jaw [Guthrie, 1970]) are linked to perceptions of social dominance in people(Keating, 1985, 1987; Keating, Mazur, and Segall, 1981). This correlation emergedamong a majority of observers in at least 10 of the 11 diverse cultural settings thatKeating et al. studied. Consequently, if females find social dominance attractive inmen, then women should rate mature male facial features more favorably than imma-ture ones on measures of sexual attractiveness.Keating (1985) constructed mature and immature facial composites from Identi-Kit materials (typically used by police departments to create facial composites of sus-pects), manipulating jaw shape and size of lips, eyes, and eyebrows. In all other wayscomposites were identical. The only factor distinguishing "male" and "female" faceswas hairdo. Subjects rated composites on scales for dominance and attractiveness.While mature features similarly boosted the dominance ratings of both male andfemale composites, a divergence occurred in ratings of attractiveness. Mature malefaces were rated considerably more attractive; mature female faces were rated some-what less attractive. On a scale of 1-to-7 (1 = very unattractive, 7 = very attractive),women gave immature and mature male composites mean ratings of 2.48 and 4.40,respectively. In short, female perceptions of male attractiveness increased in responseto morphological enhancements of facial dominance signals.One would expect, however, there to be some threshold (possibly signaled by grayhair, stressed skin, baldness, etc.) after which "mature" features come to be seen as"old" and diminish in appeal. In our natural environment, male mate value must havedecreased in old age when a man's ability to acquire resources and protect his family-or even to live long enough to complete the cycle of investment in a maturing child-weakened.

Height
Height is associated with power and status and in empirical studies has been shown tomarkedly affect one individual's ability to dominate another (Handwerker & Crosbie,1982). In an array of situations, male height confers an economic, political, and socialadvantage (Gillis, 1982). Economically, taller men are more likely to be hired, tend toreceive higher starting salaries, and are more likely to get promoted than shorter men.Politically, taller men tend to receive more votes in political elections (the taller can-didate won 80% of U.S. presidential elections between 1904 and 1980), and voters tendto overestimate the height of their favored presidential candidate. Socially, people gen-erally overestimate the height of individuals who are high status, whom they like, orwhom they agree with. The opposite is true for individuals who are low status, disliked,or disagreed with. (These findings are discussed at length by Gillis [1982].) Most com-pelling, cross-cultural ethnographic reports suggest that in many parts of the world theability to achieve positions of power is strongly rooted in relative height (Bernard,1928; Gregor, 1979; Handwerker & Crosbie, 1982; Werner, 1982). Brown and Chia-yun (n.d.) document that the term "big man" or terms very close to it are found inaboriginal languages throughout much of the world and are used to denote persons ofauthority or importance. Brown and Chia-yun argue that, in fact, the term is a confla-tion of physical size and social rank and that "big men" are consistently big men, tallin stature.This array of sociopolitical advantages presumably accrues to tall males becauseheight constitutes a reliable cue to dominance in social interactions. Taller men areperceived as more dominant than shorter men. (For example, shorter policeman aremore likely to be assaulted than taller policemen [Gregor, 1979], suggesting that thelatter commands more fear and respect from adversaries.) It follows, therefore, thattaller males would be preferred by other males as economic and political allies (receiv-ing better jobs, more electoral victories, etc.) and by women as mates. If dominance isan important aspect of male mate value, then tallness should enhance female percep-tions of male sexual and romantic attractiveness.There are important constraining influences on height, however, that do not applyto most of the other traits discussed in this chapter. Whereas it is probably impossibleto rank too high in status or dominance hierarchies, it is possible to be too tall. Withrespect to height and many other anatomical characteristics, natural selection tends tofavor the population mean, weeding out the tails of the distribution (Symons, 1979).Ecological constraints probably caused natural selection to penalize very tall men (e.g.,more broken bones, higher metabolic costs, poorer balance and agility, awkward gaitand body carriage; see, e.g., Haldane, 1985), causing optimal male height to convergeon some constrained limit. The hypothesis that males near the midpoint of the pop-ulation distribution will be the most viable, and thus should be most attractive tofemales, has been called the "central tendency" hypothesis. In contrast, the hypothesisthat females will prefer dominant males, all else equal, predicts that women will prefermen who are somewhat taller than average, although within limits set by optimal sizeconstraints.Some preliminary data have been collected. Graziano, Brothen, and Berscheid(1978) had short (under 5 ft., 4 in.), medium (5 ft., 4 in. to 5 ft., 6 in.), and tall (over 5ft., 6 in.) women judge pictures of men who they believed to be short (5 ft., 6 in.), medium (5 ft., 10 in.), or tall (6 ft., 3 in.) on attractiveness and dating desirability.Women of all three height categories rated tall men more positively than short menon both measures; however, the medium-height males were clearly preferred overall.There was no interaction between the height of the evaluator and the height of thestimulus person. This preference for 5 ft., 10 in. males is consistent with the findingsof Beigel (1954) and Gillis and Avis (1980), who investigated stated height preferencesfor ideal mates. Beigel's female sample (average height 5 ft., 3.5 in.) stated a mean pref-erence for males who were taller than themselves by 6.7 in. Gillis and Avis's femalesample (height unreported) stated a mean preference for males who were taller thanthemselves by 6.0 in. From this it can be calculated that both samples (assuming thelatter approximates the U.S. population mean of 5 ft., 4 in. for females) preferredmales who were about 5 ft., 10 in., on average. Since the population mean in the U.S.is 5 ft., 10 in. for males, these figures fit the central tendency hypothesis better than thedominance hypothesis. However, as suggested by the Graziano et al. data, deviationsaway from the central tendency are more tolerated by women in the tall than shortdirection. Cross-cultural testing is needed. In the only ethnographic study I could findon the relationship between height and sexual attractiveness, Gregor (1979) reportsthat tall males are strongly preferred by females as both lovers and mates among theMehinaku Indians of central Brazil.If the central tendency hypothesis is true, then this could have been engineered bya psychological mechanism that specifies a rule such as "Choose a man whose heightis such that when you are looking him in the eyes the visual angle subtended is X."This could account for the 6 to 6.7 in. finding, as well as the well-established trend formen and women to mate assortively on height, that is, for short to marry short and tallto marry tall (Gillis & Avis, 1980; McManus & Mascie-Taylor, 1984). (Perhaps angleX is calibrated experientially to reflect the mean difference in height between men andwomen in the local population.)The most salient criterion concerning height that women apply to men appears tobe the "male-taller norm," which is so prevalent that it has been called the "cardinalprinciple of date selection" (Berscheid & Walster, 1974). Gillis and Avis (1980) exam-ined height data collected from the bank account applications of 720 couples. Incred-ibly, in only one case was the woman taller than the man. Sheppard and Strathman(1989) had women view photographs of male-female dyads in which the male was pic-tured as approximately 5 in. taller than the female, equal in height to the female, or 5in. shorter than the female. The same dyad was featured in each photograph. On a scaleof 1-to-9 (1 = very unattractive, 9 = very attractive), the male target received meanratings of 6.00 in the male-taller/female-shorter condition, 5.00 in the equal-heightcondition, and 4.10 in the female-taller/male-shorter condition. A study by Lang(1979) may shed light on some of the affective dimensions underlying these ratingchanges. Lang looked at women's height preferences using both the Thematic Apper-ception Test (TAT), where subjects are shown a picture and asked to make up a storyabout it, and a brief questionnaire. For the TAT, subjects were shown drawings of aman and woman of discrepant heights out on the town together. In response to thefemale-taller/male-shorter picture, all subjects-even those stating adamantly on thequestionnaire that the size of a man made no difference to them-invented storieswith negative outcomes, depicting the male as "anxious" or "weak." In the male-taller/female-shorter condition, women made up stories with bland or reasonably optimistic outcomes in which the male was typically described as confident, reassur-ing, and understanding. For many of the women, avowed attitudes on the question-naire were quite different from the feelings evidenced in their stories-feelings asso-ciated with dominance perceptions of the male partner.Assuming that (a) female height is normally distributed and (b) mean femaleheight is less than mean male height, then a man who is shorter than his female partnerwill, on average, be shorter than the population average for men. Thus, the "male-taller norm" is consistent with the central tendency hypothesis. However, the TATresults suggest that dominance considerations do play a role, if only in setting a lowerlimit on acceptable male height. Furthermore, male height emerges as an importantfactor in real dating behavior. Taller men are more sought after in women's personaladvertisements (Cameron, Oskamp, & Sparks, 1978), receive more responses to theirown personal advertisements (Lynn & Shurgot, 1984), and tend to have prettier girl-friends (Feingold, 1982) than do shorter men. In addition, the "male-taller norm"appears to be enforced more strongly by women than by men. While Gillis and Avis(1980) and Beigel (1954) found that females preferred males who were taller by 6 in.and 6.7 in., respectively, the males in both studies sought females who were shorter byonly 4.5 in. In sum, the data at this point are too sparse and potentially contradictoryto decide between the central tendency and dominance hypotheses.

A MATE CHOICE PARADOX
Two of the mate characteristics examined in the IMSP (Buss et al., 1990) were "goodfinancial prospect" and "favorable social status." Both received fairly low ratings fromwomen (1.76 and 1.46, respectively, on a 0-to-3 scale [0 = irrelevant, 3 = indispens-able], collapsed across the 37 samples). In line with this trend, the U.S. sample ratedboth these attributes quite low. Considering the literature reviewed in this chapter,these results seem contradictory. For instance, it is known that in the United Statesthe men whom women actually choose to marry make 50% more money, on average,than men of the same age whom they do not choose to marry (Trivers, 1985). Alongthese lines, male medical students report that their increasing socioeconomic statustends to markedly enlarge their pool of available sexual and marital partners (Town-send, 1987). Moreover, in a study of selections made at a major commercial datingservice, social status emerged as the single most important criterion women applied tomen (Green, Buchanan, & Heuer, 1984).A similar inconsistency emerges between women's stated preference for domi-nance per se and actual response to dominance signals. Buss and Barnes (1986)assessed major dimensions of mate choice in American married couples via the Mar-ital Preferences Questionnaire, which consists of 76 adjective-items, which subjectsrate on a 5-point scale of desirability. Both women and men rated "dominant" asamong the least desirable mate characteristics. Yet, as we have seen, most womenrespond positively to actual dominance traits expressed in videotapes, pictures, orwritten descriptions, at least when dominance was expressed toward other men.This discrepancy between avowed preferences on questionnaires, on the one hand,and actual responses in many real-life situations and experimental settings, on theother, may have numerous causes. I will discuss four possibilities.

1. Conflation of group and dyadic dominance. Unless a measuring instrument spe-cifically distinguishes between group and dyadic dominance (Hinde, 1978), subjectsare likely to conflate these two concepts in their responses. Women may respond sonegatively to "dominance" as a mate characteristic because they perceive it as the pro-clivity of a male to dominate them. If dominance were presented in terms of a man'sability to interact confidently and successfully with other males (as it is in some of theexperiments described above), then it should receive more favorable reviews.

2. The social desirability issue. It is possible that many women are interested informing relationships with dominant and/or high-status men but are reluctant toadmit such motives. American women who marry for money are stigmatized as "gold-diggers," and the words "status" and "dominance" have negative connotations forsome people in our society. Some female writers who address the question, "What dowomen find attractive in men?," cloak the issues of status and dominance in euphe-misms that seem designed in part to conceal the real political and socioeconomic basisof much female choice (D. Symons, personal communication, 1987). Thus Flood(1981) and Shanor (1977), for example, suggest that what matters most to women aresuch things as "Who a manis," "How he fits into the world," "How he handles him-self," and "How he responds to other people."

3. The preference for dominant, high-status men may be real but unconscious.Recall the discussion of female height preferences and the incongruity between thesubjects' stated attitudes and TAT outcomes. Women seemed to be responding to adominance cue (height), while at the same time insisting that height was not impor-tant. It is possible that many women are simply not aware of their inclination to per-ceive and evaluate status and dominance cues favorably. Perhaps these cues evoke anemotional response in women that affects their feelings of attraction toward a male,without them being consciously aware that their response was activated by these cues.Their response might be automatic and its cause not consciously accessible.

4. Women's questionnaire responses may be biased by a "threshold effect" (D.Symons, personal communication, 1987). This point can be illustrated by recountinga short story about three upper-middle-class women going out to lunch together inNew York City and complaining that "there are no men!" But there were men allaround them: service peoplein the restaurant. Such working-class males were sociallyinvisible to these upper-middle-class females because they were below the necessarythreshold of social and economic status.What could be occurring, then, is that when women fill out a questionnaire onmate preferences they are thinking only about those males who are above their statusthreshold and thus within their range of vision. Within that range, status differencesmay be relatively unimportant (as compared with other qualities such as kindness orhonesty, which are consistently rated as highly desirable mate characteristics bywomen). However, status may still have the huge effect of setting a minimum thresh-old, and thereby ruling out much of the male population as potential mates for upper-middle-class women. Townsend and Levy (1990b) provide considerable empiricalsupport for this hypothesis. This reasoning implies that in an investigation of matepreferences, researchers should have subjects not only rank the desirability of variouscharacteristics, but also statetheir minimum criterion for each characteristic and ratewhat percentage of the population meets their minimum criterion. Kenrick, Sadalla,Groth, and Trost (1990) have begun this project. 

MATE PREFERENCES IN AN UNKNOWN CULTURE
Donald Symons (1979, 1987a) has reviewed a great deal of ethnographic and psycho-logical literature on perceptions of sexual attractiveness. In summarizing the maleexperience of sexual attraction, Symons (1987b) asks his readers to imagine that aheretofore unknown tribal people is suddenly discovered. Drawing on touchstones ofhis cross-cultural review, Symons lists the characteristics that he predicts will consti-tute the ideal sexual partner of the average man in this culture. My intention is to takeSymons's list full circle and to summarize my own analysis. I predict the averagewoman in this culture will seek the following characteristics in her ideal mate:

	1. He will be dependable, emotionally stable and mature, and kind/consideratetoward her.
	2. He will be generous. He may communicate a spirit of caring through a will-ingness to share time and whatever commodities are valued in this culturewith the woman in question.
	3. He will be ambitious and perceived by the woman in question as clever orintelligent.
	4. He will be genuinely interested in the woman in question, and she in him. Hemay express his interest through displays of concern for her well-being.
	5. He will have a strong social presence and be well liked and respected by others.He will possess a strong sense of efficacy, confidence, and self-respect.
	6. He will be good with, interested in, and/or show a general fondness for chil-dren.
	7. He will possess whatever skills, accoutrements, physical features, and eco-nomic capabilities happen to be reliably associated with high status in this cul-ture.
	8. He will possess the skills, behavioral tendencies, and physical characteristicsthat enable him to protect the woman in question from physical attack orintimidation and will exhibit signs that he is willing to do so.
	9. He will evidence signs of health and vitality, such as firm muscle tone, clearskin, upright posture, and energetic body language. He will be taller than thewoman in question, have mature physiognomic features, and display a generalease and freedom of body movements.
	10. He will not be a man with whom the woman in question grew up with as achild (see Shepher, 1983).

Predictions 1, 3, 7, and 10 are "safe" in the sense that they are supported by a gooddeal of ethnographic and psychological data on human mate selection. Predictions 2,4, 5, 6, 8, and 9 are as yet untested or insufficiently tested (e.g., relevant data have beencollected in only one culture), though each is falsifiable. These latter six predictions areessentially derived from my interpretations of human evolutionary theory. Of coursealternative evolutionary scenarios could be generated and competing hypotheses pro-posed and empirically tested against these.The foregoing predictions are limited by their paucity and generality. The humanexperience is manifold. Experiences of sexual attraction in the newly discovered cul-ture will undoubtedly encompass preferences and feelings far more varied and elaborate than this limited set of predictions can capture. The Darwinian analysis scarcelyilluminates the idiosyncrasies of individuals and cultures. It sheds light on basicdesires-motives, drives, proclivities, aspirations-but it cannot predict the broadarray of tactics deployed in our attempts to satisfy those desires. In any given culture,empirical studies are needed to identify the behavioral strategies through whichdesiderata are sought, as well as the proximate mechanisms that fashion thosestrategies.Many of the psychological mechanisms underpinning feelings of sexual attractionin this culture will depend on ontogenetic experiences for their expression. The abilityto discriminate between high- and low-status individuals and between fathers who arewilling to make long-term commitments to offspring and pretenders who are not is afunction of experience. Nonetheless, it is the very nature of our psychological struc-tures that allows us to (a) extract relevant information (such as that concerning matevalue) from our experiences in the first place and (b) use that information quickly andefficiently to solve adaptive problems(such as whom to feel sexual attraction toward).Our psychological mechanisms -- specialized and goal-directed-allow us to learn theright things in the learning situations typically encountered in our evolutionary past.The psychological mechanisms underlying perceptions of sexual attractiveness shouldbe sensitive to environmental cues that correlate with mate value.In comparison to my forecasts on mate preferences among this newly discoveredculture, what might a mainstream social scientist predict? Probably nothing at all. Var-ious social scientists (e.g., Futuyama & Risch, 1984; Hoult, 1984; Simon & Gagnon,1969) claim that humans inherit onlya diffuse biological potential-a generalized sexdrive that is predisposed toward nothing and, therefore, cannot be predicted in advance(cf. Symons, 1987b). By this reasoning, men and women could just as easily beattracted to tree trunks as other people if they were culturally conditioned to do so,and the distribution of sex differences across cultures should be random. From anadaptive viewpoint, such people could just as easily learn the wrong things as the rightones, and they could be manipulated against their selective interests by others (cf. Bar-kow, 1989; Cosmides & Tooby, 1987).The central premise of this chapter-that women will respond preferentially tomen displaying traits indicative of high mate value-does not imply that women con-sciously appraise men through the sharp eye of maternal pragmatism. When a womanexperiences feelings of sexual attraction, she is not, at an unconscious level, "plotting"a reproductive strategy designed to maximize the representation of her genes in futuregenerations. Rather, she is probably simply experiencing desire for the man in ques-tion; this desire may or may not enhance reproductive success in the milieu where itis experienced. But underlying the nature and intensity of that desire is a complex hostof psychological mechanisms, and these mechanisms should have been designed bynatural selection to detect and prefer male traits that in our natural environment werereliably associated with (a) the ability and willingness to provide economically, (b) theability and willingness to protect a woman from physical attack or intimidation, and(c) the ability and willingness to engage in direct parenting activities such as teaching,nurturing, and providing social support and opportunities. Taken together, thesepreferences form a coherent, integrated system that throughout our evolutionaryhistory presumably had the effect of causing women to choose men of high matevalue.
