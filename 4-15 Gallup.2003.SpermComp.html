Abstract
Inanimate models were used to assess the possibility that certain features of the human penisevolved to displace semen left by other males in the female reproductive tract. Displacement ofartificial semen in simulated vaginas varied as a function of glans/coronal ridge morphology, semenviscosity, and depth of thrusting. Results obtained by modifying an artificial penis suggest that thecoronal ridge is an important morphological feature mediating semen displacement. Consistent withthe view of the human penis as a semen displacement device, two surveys of college studentsshowed that sexual intercourse often involved deeper and more vigorous penile thrusting followingperiods of separation or in response to allegations of female infidelity.D 2003 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
To maximize the likelihood of paternity, human males have evolved several strategies.Daly and Wilson (1998) list mate guarding, as a means of minimizing the chances of thefemale becoming involved in an extra pair copulation, and using the degree to whichchildren show paternal resemblance to assess paternity. There is a third class of putativepaternal assurance tactics. In the event of extra pair copulation, strategies on the part of the resident male for preventing conception by an interloper may involve differentparameters of sperm competition. Baker and Bellis (1989) have shown that the less oftena man sees his partner over a 3-day period, the higher his sperm count upon resumingsexual intercourse, implicating mechanisms that may function to compete with sperm ofrival males.While the first few drops of ejaculate facilitate sperm transport, the last few havespermicidal properties (Baker & Bellis, 1995). Therefore, in the event of a double mating,the second male’s sperm would be met with a spermicidal layer left by the first. Men withprostate or seminal vesicle dysfunction sometimes have a reversed seminal fluid sequenceand are often rendered infertile (Kvist, 1991). The first few drops of ejaculate also function toprotect sperm from spermicide left by previous males, and therefore improve the secondmale’s chances of achieving conception (Lindholmer, 1973).Species differences in genital morphology can arise by sexual selection (Dixson, 1987;Eberhard, 1996; Verrell, 1992). Thus, the morphology of the human penis itself may havebeen influenced by sperm competition. Relative to other primates, the human penis is largerin both width and length, roughly twice as long and wide as that of our closest living relative,the chimpanzee (Short, 1980). The shape of the human penis also differs from many otherprimates because the glans is more exaggerated and uniquely configured (Izor, Walchuk, &Wilkins, 1981). The diameter of the posterior glans is larger than the penis shaft itself, and thecoronal ridge, which rises at the interface between the glans and the shaft, is positionedperpendicular to the shaft. The human penis may displace seminal fluid from other males inthe vagina by forcing it back around the glans. The effect of thrusting, according to thisanalysis, would be to draw foreign semen back away from the cervix. Because of its elasticity,the vagina expands around the penis during intromission creating suction that may furtherenhance this effect. If a female copulated with more than one male within a short period oftime, this would allow subsequent males to ‘‘scoop out’’ semen left by others beforeejaculating (Baker & Bellis, 1995).Although there are no empirical data that bear on the semen displacement hypothesis,some behavioral implications of sperm competition in humans have been examined.Shackelford et al. (2002) found that after separation, males in committed relationships ratetheir partners as more attractive, show greater interest in copulating with them, and think thattheir partners are more sexually interested in them.To test the displacement hypothesis, we measured the magnitude of semen displacementaffected by various artificial genitals, different simulated semen recipes, different semenviscosities, and different depths of thrusting. Two surveys were also conducted to corroborateand extend the results obtained using laboratory analogs.

2. Experiment 1
In the first experiment, sexual encounters were simulated using artificial genitals and themagnitude of artificial semen displacement was measured as a function of penis size, shape,and depth of thrusting. The genital models are depicted in Fig. 1. The latex phallus B was 155 mm long and 33 mmin diameter (Hollywood Exotic Novelties) with a coronal ridge extending approximately5 mm from the shaft. The latex phallus D was the same length, but was 27 mm in diameterwith a coronal ridge extending 3 mm from the shaft (Hollywood Erotique Novelties). Theplastic shaft C lacked a coronal ridge, measured 155 mm in length with a diameter of 29 mm,and was used as a control phallus. These dimensions are well within human parameters. Thetypical erect human penis ranges from 127 mm to 178 mm in length, with a diameter of24.5 mm (Masters & Johnson, 1966; Wessells, Lue, & McAninch, 1996).The artificial vagina (California Exotic Novelties), marketed as a male masturbationdevice, measured 113 mm in length, with a 51-mm vaginal barrel, and was 26 mm indiameter. The vagina (labeled A) consisted of a hollow tube of highly flexible elastic material,which when stretched measured approximately 102 mm in length. As shown in Fig. 1, the‘‘cervical’’ end of this tube was closed with a rubber band to prevent semen leakage duringdisplacement trials. Simulated semen was created by mixing 7 ml of water at roomtemperature with 7.16 g of cornstarch and stirring for 5 min. After trying different mixturesof cornstarch and water, this recipe was judged by three sexually experienced males to bestapproximate the viscosity and texture of human seminal fluid. To avoid thickening of thesemen over time, new mixtures of artificial semen were created after every two to three trials.Five displacement trials were conducted with each phallus. For each trial, the vagina wasweighed after applying several drops of water-based lubricant (California Exotic Novelties) to the vaginal opening and inserting 2.6 ml of simulated semen into the vagina with a syringe.The volume of human ejaculate ranges from 2 to 6 ml with an average of 3 ml (Belsey,Eliasson, & Gallegos, 1999). After being loaded with semen, the vagina was stretched andheld against a fiberglass base positioned at an angle of 45j (see Fig. 2), while a phallus wasfully inserted into the vagina and withdrawn. Upon withdrawing a phallus to within 25 mmfrom the opening, the vaginal wall below the glans was pinched closed to prevent semen fromflowing back into the vagina. The amount of semen pulled to the outer portion of the vaginawas then removed and the vagina was weighed. The percentage of semen displaced wascalculated as follows:

((weight of vagina with semen - weight of vagina following insertion and removal of phallus)/(weight of vagina with semen - weight of empty vagina)) * 100

In the second phase of this experiment, the B phallus was inserted into the vagina atdifferent depths (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) to assess the effect of thrusting depth on semendisplacement. Displacement was measured in the same way and the percentage of semendisplaced was calculated over five trials for each depth.

2.2. Results
As shown in Fig. 3, the magnitude of displacement varied as a function of penismorphology. Phalluses B and D each displaced approximately 91% of the simulated semen,but phallus C, with no coronal ridge, displaced only 35.3% [F(12) = 41.56, P < .0001] Videotapes of the trials revealed that when either penis B or D was fully inserted into thevagina, rather than forcing the semen over the coronal ridge, the semen flowed back underthe penis through the frenulum and then collected over the top of the anterior shaft behind thecoronal ridge (see Fig. 2).As shown in Fig. 4, variation in depth of thrusting was associated with significant variationin semen displacement [F(16) = 330.74, P < .0001]. When phallus B was inserted all the wayinto the vagina, 90% of the semen (M = 90.44%, S.D. = 9.89) was displaced, whereasinsertion three fourths of the way only displaced about one third (38.95%) of the semen(P < .001). There was no semen displacement under conditions of more shallow thrusting (seeFig. 4). The correlation between depth of thrusting and semen displacement was r = .927(P < .0001).

3. Experiment 2
Using a different artificial vagina and a different semen recipe, a second experiment wasconducted to replicate and extend these effects. Displacement was measured across two levelsof semen viscosity, and the coronal ridge was removed from one phallus to assess the effecton semen displacement.

3.1. Methods
As shown in Fig. 5, a different artificial vagina (New Concepts) measuring 138 mm inlength and 43 mm in diameter was used. Because it was longer than vagina A, the cervicalend of vagina E was tied off with a rubber band so that when stretched it was the samelength (i.e., 102 mm). The same three phalluses were deployed in this experiment. A newrecipe for simulating semen (see Acknowledgements) consisted of 18.8 g of sifted, white,unbleached flour mixed with 250 ml of water. This mixture was brought to a boil, simmeredfor 15 min while being stirred, and allowed to cool. The procedures for loading the vaginawith semen, inserting the phallus, and measuring displacement were the same as in theprevious experiment.In the first phase, five displacement trials were conducted with each of the threephalluses. In the next phase, semen viscosity was manipulated by diluting the flour andwater mixture with additional water to produce two levels of viscosity. The thick semenconsisted of approximately 0.147 g flour/ml water, and the thin semen consisted of 0.126 gflour/ml water. To compensate for evaporation, small amounts of water were added periodically to each semen mixture during testing to maintain the original viscosities. Threesexually experienced males rated the dilute (thin) semen as the closest approximation tohuman semen. Five trials were conducted with each level of semen viscosity using vagina Eand each of the three phallus types.In the final phase of Experiment 2, we assessed the effect of the coronal ridge on semendisplacement. Using a knife, the coronal ridge was removed from phallus D taking care not todestroy the glans. Fine sandpaper and an emory board were used to smooth the area that hadbeen cut away, and the resulting phallus (designated D - ) is depicted in Fig. 5. Using thelow-viscosity flour and water semen mixture, five displacement trials were conducted withboth the intact and modified phallus.

3.2. Results
As was true for cornstarch, the dilute semen lead to comparable displacement effects as afunction of phallus morphology. Phallus B displaced an average of 97.8%, phallus D 86.7%,and phallus C 28.9% [(F(12) = 61.66, P < .0001]. The effects of semen viscosity and phallustype were examined using a 3 x 2 factorial design. As shown in Fig. 6, there was a maineffect of Phallus Type [F(2,29) = 108.15, P < .0001], a main effect of Semen Viscosity[F(1,29) = 13.49, P < .001], but no Phallus Type x Semen Viscosity interaction.As shown in Figs. 3 and 6, the displacement effect held up well across the two differentvaginas. Although there appeared to be slightly greater displacement effects for vagina A, thedifferences between A and E were not statistically significant.The two latex phalluses (B and D) differed from the plastic control phallus (C) not only interms of morphological features (e.g., the glans/coronal ridge), but also in terms of texture(see Fig. 1). In an attempt to resolve this problem and isolate the critical semen displacementfeature, the coronal ridge was removed from phallus D. The magnitude of displacement using thin viscosity flour semen was substantially affected. Phallus D, with an intact coronal ridge,displaced over twice as much semen (86.69%) than did the same phallus (D -) without the coronal ridge (40.03%) [t(8) = 7.49, P < .0001].

4. Survey 1
The results obtained with prosthetic genitals suggest that the magnitude of in vivo semendisplacement would also be expected to vary as a function of the depth of thrusting. Ananonymous survey was used to determine if allegations of female infidelity affectparameters of intercourse in ways that are consistent with the results obtained usinginanimate analogs.

4.1. Methods
Three hundred and thirty-six undergraduate college students (131 males, 205 females) atthe State University of New York at Albany responded to an anonymous written question-naire (approved by the Institutional Review Board). Forty-one respondents never had sexualintercourse and were excluded from the analysis, leaving 122 males and 173 females.The survey posed questions to participants about their sexual experiences, includingcontexts in which they or their partner had ever been accused of cheating or beingunfaithful. They were asked if they had intercourse following allegations of infidelity, andif so, how long intercourse lasted, how quickly thrusting occurred, and how deep thrusting was. Subjects were asked to rate changes in their sexual behavior compared to typical ornormal intercourse using three-point scales ( - 1 = less; 0 = no change; 1 = greater).

4.2. Results
Not all participants answered all questions. Of those who experienced intercoursefollowing allegations of female infidelity, just over half (54 males and 68 females)reported noticing a difference in sexual behavior. As shown in Figs. 7 and 8, a greaterproportion of males and females who noticed a difference reported deeper thrusting afterallegations of infidelity [one-sample t test, M = .685, t(110) = 11.968, P < .0001], and thesame was true for speed of thrusting [one-sample t test, M = .686, t(85) = 9.983,P < .0001]. Duration of intercourse and length of orgasm, however, did not differ fromtypical encounters.Broken down by sex, males reported that after allegations of infidelity, they thrust deeper[one-sample t test, M = .685, t(53) = 9.266, P < .0001] and faster [one-sample t test, M = .579,t(37) = 5.557, P < .0001]. Females also reported that males thrust deeper [one-sample t test,M = 98.685, t(56) = 7.839, P < .0001] and quicker [one-sample t test, M = .771, t(47) = 8.517,P < .0001].

5. Survey 2
Another survey was used to determine if periods of separation between couples changesexual behavior in ways consistent with the displacement hypothesis. Two hundred and eighty-six undergraduate college students (91 males, 195 females) at theState University of New York at Albany responded to an anonymous questionnaire approvedby the University Institutional Review Board.Participants were asked whether they were sexually active, if they were currently in asexual relationship, and how long it had lasted. They were also asked about instances in which they and their partner had been separated, and if they had intercourse followingreunion, how long intercourse lasted, how quickly thrusting occurred, how deep and vigorousthrusting was, the approximate number of thrusts, and the intensity of orgasm. Subjects ratedchanges in their sexual behavior compared to normal encounters using five-point scales( - 2 = much less; - 1 = less; 0 = no change; 1 = greater; 2 = much greater). Forty-fourrespondents never had sexual intercourse and two who declined to answer the question wereexcluded from the analysis, leaving 81 males and 159 females.

5.2. Results
Not all participants answered all questions. Almost three out of four (73.3%, N = 176)reported having intercourse with their partner following a period of separation. Length ofseparation ranged from 1 to 438 days, with an average (mode) of 14 days. Of those whoexperienced a sexual encounter following separation, 7 out of 10 (69.3%, 34 males, 88females) noticed a difference in their own or their partner’s sexual behavior.Using one-sample t tests (see Figs. 9 and 10), both sexes who noted a difference reportedthat thrusting was deeper [M = .856, t(166) = 13.684, P < .0001], quicker [M = .566,t(167) = 8.396, P < .0001], more frequent [M = .633, t(165) = 9.613, P < .0001], and more vigorous [M = .524, t(163) = 7.437, P < .0001] following separation. When broken down bysex, males reported deeper [M = .845, t(57) = 7.193, P < .0001], faster [M = .500,t(57) = 4.216, P < .0001], and more vigorous [M = .418, t(54) = 3.543, P < .0001] thrusting,as well as more thrusts [M = .597, t(56) = 4.984, P < .0001] after a separation. Females alsoreported deeper [M = .863, t(108) = 11.794, P < .0001], faster [M = .600, t(109) = 7.327,P < .0001], and more vigorous [M = .578, t(108) = 6.589, P < .0001] thrusting by theirpartners, as well as more thrusts [M = .651, t(108) = 8.286, P < .0001]

6. Discussion
Simulating a sexual encounter in vitro, we found that phalluses with a glans/coronal ridgeconfiguration that approximated a human penis resulted in appreciable displacement ofsimulated semen. Depth of thrusting was also an important parameter, with significantdisplacement occurring only when the penis was inserted 75% or more of the way into thevagina, forcing the semen under the frenulum and causing it to flow back around the shaft andcollect behind the coronal ridge (see Fig. 2).A limitation of our attempts to model semen displacement was the greater rigidity of theprosthetic as compared to real genitals. The artificial vaginas did not expand as readily as realvaginal tissue nor did the phalluses compress, and, as a result, semen displacement wasassessed on the basis of a single insertion. The effects, however, were robust and generalizedacross different artificial phalluses, different artificial vaginas, different types of simulatedsemen, and different semen viscosities. In spite of variation in diameter and coronal ridgeconfiguration, phalluses B and D (see Fig. 1) produced roughly equivalent displacement,suggesting that comparable effects would be obtained over a variety of prosthetic genitalparameters. Severing the glans from phallus D diminished displacement to levels commensurate with those obtained for control phallus C, thus implicating the coronal ridge as animportant semen displacement feature.Whereas the different semen recipes led to comparable displacement effects, magnitude ofdisplacement varied with semen viscosity (see Fig. 6). Individual differences in semenviscosity among males are associated with differences in fertility. Semen hyperviscosityimpairs sperm motility (Mendeluk, Munuce, Carizza, Sardi, & Bregni, 1997). Our data,relating the magnitude of displacement to viscosity, suggest that the penis is more effective atdisplacing low-viscosity, more mobile semen.Masters and Johnson (1966) reported ballooning of the cervical end of the vagina duringintercourse, which, if true, might diminish a displacement effect. However, Weijmar-Schultz,van Andel, Sabelis, and Mooyart (1999) recently conducted a magnetic resonance imagingstudy of male and female genitals during coitus. Their results show that during completepenetration, the penis can stretch the anterior wall of the vagina and even raise the uterus, butthey found no evidence of a ballooning effect.While only suggestive, the data from both behavioral surveys are consistent with thesemen displacement hypothesis. Following separation from their partners, or when maleswere sexually jealous, thrusting was rated as being deeper and more vigorous. Althoughspeed and duration of thrusting were not manipulated using prosthetic genitals, these havebeen implicated in displacing vaginal secretions (O’Hara & O’Hara, 1999). Thus, many malesappear to alter their sexual behavior in ways that may displace a rival male’s semen in theevent of infidelity on the part of their partners. Baker and Bellis (1995) speculated that thelonger the duration of intercourse, the more material would be removed from the vagina. Butthis assumes that number of thrusts vary with duration of intercourse. We found nodifferences in duration of intercourse, but males and females both reported quicker, morevigorous thrusting that could increase the number of thrusts per encounter.The surveys have limitations. First, periods of separation may be confounded with timesince the last ejaculation. This assumes, of course, that males do not pursue alternative meansof achieving ejaculation during the interim. Because males often use masturbation as acopulation substitute, this assumption may be unfounded. Moreover, time since the lastcopulatory ejaculation poses the same adaptive problem even if the couple has not beenformally separated. Just as the likelihood of infidelity on the part of the female could vary as afunction of extended separation, the same would apply during briefer periods of informalseparation throughout the day (e.g., going to the store, work, or school). Unless the female issequestered and guarded on a continuous basis, as the time since last ejaculation increases sowould the risk of sperm competition. Thus, deeper, more vigorous thrusting as a function oftime since the last copulatory ejaculation could function as a more generalized spermcompetition mechanism.Another potential problem with the survey results are demand characteristics; i.e., malesmay think that deeper, more vigorous thrusting is a more appropriate response followingseparation or female infidelity. If true, however, the mere existence of such a cognitive biaswould be consistent with our hypothesis. In addition, the accounts given by females ofdifferent features of sexual behavior following separation or allegations of female infidelitywere the same as the males’. Also, contrary to demand characteristics, changes in sexual behavior were specific to features related to semen displacement; i.e., there were no reporteddifferences in the duration of intercourse or incidence of orgasm.Taken together, the results of the surveys along with the data derived from the artificialgenitals suggest that the genital anatomy and copulatory behavior of human males has beenshaped by a history of sperm competition.
